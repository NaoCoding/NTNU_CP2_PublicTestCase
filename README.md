`This repo is for recording and saving all the testcases of` [NTNU_CP2's](https://sites.google.com/gapps.ntnu.edu.tw/neokent/teaching/2025spring-computer-programming-ii?authuser=0) `homeworks and exams.`

`The reason why I must record and save all the testcases is because I am the teaching assistant during 2025 spring. `

`Therefore, this repo is kind of useless (and you can skip it) unless you are a student in NTNU CP2 (Spring 2025)`
