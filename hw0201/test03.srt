1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,205
So today, what I want to do

2
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:05,959
is talk to you about the most important
conversations you have each day:

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,211
the conversations
you have with yourselves.

4
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:09,504
My name is Ethan Kross.

5
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:12,007
I’m the director of the 
Emotion and Self Control Lab

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:13,508
at the University of Michigan,

7
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:14,843
and for the past 25 years,

8
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:18,263
I've been studying how people
can manage their emotions.

9
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:21,933
And one of the things that I've learned
during that time -- (Object drops)

10
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:23,894
See? I'm managing my emotions right now.

11
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:25,353
(Laughter)

12
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:28,690
One of the things
that I've learned during that time

13
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:31,693
is that a key to managing
one's emotions effectively

14
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:36,156
involves understanding
how to harness this mysterious force

15
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:39,076
called the voices inside our head.

16
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:42,204
Now I realize some of you
may be asking yourself right now,

17
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:44,873
“What is a purported
serious scientist doing

18
00:00:44,874 --> 00:00:50,045
talking about a squishy topic
like the voices inside our head?"

19
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:52,464
But I want to point out
the elephant in the room --

20
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:55,717
that, you know, if you've just asked
yourself that question,

21
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:57,928
you are talking to yourself.

22
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,721
And that's totally OK,

23
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:04,017
because the vast majority of us
have a voice inside our head.

24
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,686
Here's a scientific fact
that I absolutely love.

25
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:09,981
We spend between one half and 
one-third of our waking hours

26
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:11,983
not focused on the present.

27
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,069
Between one half
and one-third of the time,

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,779
our minds, they are drifting away.

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,864
We are thinking about other things.

30
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:20,117
Some of you are doing that right now.

31
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:21,326
Please stop.

32
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:23,245
(Laughter)

33
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:25,705
Once we find ourselves drifting away,

34
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:29,459
one of the things that we're doing
is talking to ourselves

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,087
and listening to what we say.

36
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:35,006
Now when scientists like myself
use the term “inner voice,”

37
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,093
what we're talking about
is our ability to silently use language

38
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:39,344
to reflect on our lives.

39
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:41,638
And it turns out this is one
of your superpowers,

40
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:45,308
because your inner voice lets you keep
information active in your head

41
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,435
for short periods of time,

42
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:49,354
like when you go to the grocery store.

43
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:52,566
And if you're like me,
15 seconds into the expedition,

44
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:56,778
you forget what you’re supposed to buy,
and you repeat that list in your head.

45
00:01:56,779 --> 00:02:01,324
"Apples, cheese. Pepto Bismol."

46
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,659
TMI.

47
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,204
We also use our inner voice
to simulate and plan,

48
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:08,874
like when we silently rehearse
what we're going to say

49
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,127
before an important presentation
or an interview.

50
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:16,965
And of course, we use our inner voice
to control and motivate ourselves,

51
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:20,218
as I did just before I came on stage.

52
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,220
It's right around the corner, over there.

53
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:26,808
I silently said to myself, "Come on, man,
you've got this. Deep breath.

54
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:28,727
45 minutes, and you are done.”

55
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,020
(Laughter)

56
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,355
And of course, all of you
just said to yourself,

57
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:35,275
"This guy thinks he's talking
for 45 minutes. He's nuts."

58
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:36,359
(Laughter)

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,654
Finally, perhaps most magically,

60
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:46,536
we use our inner voice to make sense
of this messy world that we often live in.

61
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:49,539
When we experience challenges,
we turn our attention inward,

62
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,750
and we try to work through them.

63
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,544
And our inner voice
helps us create those stories

64
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:56,922
that shape our sense of self,

65
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:59,007
stories that really craft our identity.

66
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:03,053
So your inner voice,
this is a remarkable tool.

67
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:08,683
The problem is it is a tool that often
jams up on us when we need it most.

68
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:12,562
We don't come up with clear
solutions to our problems.

69
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:15,023
We get stuck in negative
thought loops, instead.

70
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,400
We worry. We ruminate.

71
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:21,863
We experience what I call the dark side
of our inner voice: chatter.

72
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:24,324
How do you know
if you're experiencing chatter?

73
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,202
If you ever find yourself
trying to work through a problem

74
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:28,912
but not making any progress,

75
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:32,707
or if you find yourself
berating yourself incessantly --

76
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,001
"I'm an idiot, such an idiot."

77
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,712
Those are two telltale signs.

78
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:41,091
Now if this description of chatter
resonates with any of you here --

79
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:42,634
I'm sure it does not.

80
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:44,177
But if it does,

81
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:49,266
my response to you is welcome
to the human condition, my friends.

82
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,518
Chatter is a feature of it.

83
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,147
We all have the capacity
to experience it at times.

84
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,857
It also happens to be

85
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:01,069
one of the big problems
we face as a species.

86
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,572
And I say this because,
if you look at what chatter does to us,

87
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:06,574
it sinks us in three domains of life

88
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:10,537
that I would argue everyone here
cares a great deal about.

89
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:11,913
One thing that chatter does,

90
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:15,458
it makes it really hard
for us to think and perform.

91
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,085
If you've ever had the experience

92
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:19,462
of sitting down to read
a few pages in a book,

93
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,589
and under oath, you would swear to a judge

94
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,592
that you have read the words
on the screen or page,

95
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:27,679
but you get to the end
of the section, the chapter,

96
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,390
and you don't remember
a damn thing that you've read,

97
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,934
you've experienced one way
that chatter undermines us.

98
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:36,521
It consumes our attention,
leaving very little left over

99
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:39,899
to do the things that we often
want and need to do.

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,361
Chatter also creates friction
in our relationships with other people,

101
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:45,822
because when we experience chatter,

102
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:50,493
we're often highly motivated
to share its glory with those around us.

103
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:53,580
What I mean by that is we often
want to talk about our chatter,

104
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:55,415
so we find someone to talk to,

105
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:59,961
and then, we keep on talking,
over and over again.

106
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:03,631
This can have a really sad consequence

107
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:06,676
of pushing away people
who genuinely care about us,

108
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:09,846
because there's only so much
that they can endure

109
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,140
before we start to bring them down.

110
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:13,808
Then there's our health.

111
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:17,854
So chatter helps explain
how stress gets under our skin

112
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:19,397
to impact our physical health,

113
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:23,360
because what it does
is it prolongs our stress response.

114
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:27,530
And that creates a wear and tear
in our body that is physically damaging,

115
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:31,159
predicts things like problems
of cardiovascular disease, inflammation,

116
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,953
even certain forms of cancer.

117
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:35,997
Now when people hear about these findings,

118
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:39,334
the question they often ask me is:
“How can I silence this inner voice?

119
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:41,002
Just shut it up."

120
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:45,215
And I don’t think this is the best
question to be asking.

121
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:48,635
Because your inner voice
is a remarkable tool.

122
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:50,553
We don't want to get rid of that tool.

123
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:52,806
What we want to figure out
is how to harness it.

124
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,601
And this is where the really,
really good news comes into play.

125
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:59,646
This is precisely the question
that scientists like myself

126
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:02,732
have been trying to answer
for a few decades now,

127
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,693
and we have learned a lot
about the science-based tools

128
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:07,946
that exist to do precisely this.

129
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,823
Now there are many tools out there.

130
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:14,035
I'm not going to tell you about each one,
because then we would go for 45 minutes.

131
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:16,663
But I do want to share with you
three of my favorites.

132
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:19,207
And we're going to start with language.

133
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,251
Right before Malala Yousafzai

134
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:24,212
became the youngest person
to ever win the Nobel Peace Prize,

135
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:28,174
for advocating for the rights
of young girls to receive an education,

136
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:31,177
She was invited onto "The Daily
Show" with Jon Stewart

137
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:33,388
to talk about her experience.

138
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,181
At one point during the interview,

139
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:38,935
she begins to explain
what went through her head

140
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:43,731
when she first discovered that the Taliban
were plotting to kill her.

141
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:46,317
I want to present to you
a quote right here,

142
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:49,487
of how she starts to talk
about this experience.

143
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:53,283
“I used to think that the Talib
would come and he would just kill me ...”

144
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:55,535
Nothing particularly
out of the ordinary here.

145
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:57,704
She's talking to herself
in the first person,

146
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:01,124
the way we typically think
about our lives.

147
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,960
But the moment she gets
to this part of the experience,

148
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:07,922
"The Taliban, they're on my doorstep,"
"they're coming to get me."

149
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:09,632
It's what is arguably the climax,

150
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:13,094
the most stressful, chatter-provoking
event you can imagine.

151
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:17,557
Once she gets to that part,
she does something kind of strange.

152
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:19,350
I'm going to show you another quote,

153
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,311
and I want you to look at what she says.

154
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:23,521
"I asked myself,
'What would you do, Malala?'

155
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:27,901
Then I would reply to myself,
'Malala, just take a shoe and hit him.'

156
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,653
But then I said, 'If you hit
a Talib with your shoe,

157
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:33,656
then there would be no difference
between you and the Talib.’”

158
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:36,534
So she starts off in the first person,
but then she switches.

159
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:38,453
She's coaching herself.

160
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:42,081
She's giving herself advice
like she would someone else,

161
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:44,667
using her name and the word "you."

162
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:48,880
In this instance, what Malala is doing,
she's using a tool that we have studied.

163
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:51,174
It is called "distanced self-talk,"

164
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:56,221
and it is useful because we human beings
are much, much better

165
00:07:56,222 --> 00:08:00,517
at giving advice to other people
than we are taking our own advice.

166
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:03,269
So if you've ever felt
like a giant hypocrite,

167
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,438
once again, welcome
to the human condition.

168
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,941
There's even a name for this phenomenon.

169
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:11,819
It's called Solomon's paradox,
named after the Bible's King Solomon,

170
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,074
who was famous for being able
to give great advice to other people,

171
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:19,202
but when it came to his own affairs,
he stumbled mightily.

172
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:21,955
Using your own name and "you"
shifts your perspective.

173
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,623
It gets you to relate to yourself

174
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:25,959
like you were giving advice
to someone else,

175
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,089
and that makes it much, much easier for us
to wisely work through our problems.

176
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,260
Another tool you can use
to manage your chatter is other people.

177
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:40,056
But you have to be really careful
about who you go to for chatter support.

178
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:43,601
Many people think that the best way
to help someone else

179
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:46,604
is to let them vent their emotions,

180
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:50,024
but venting doesn't help us
work through our chatter.

181
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,486
I want to repeat that again,
because it's a really important take-home.

182
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:55,947
Venting doesn't help us
work through our chatter.

183
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:57,615
Venting is really useful

184
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:01,619
for strengthening the friendship
and relational bonds between people.

185
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,705
It is good to know that someone's there,

186
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:07,667
they're willing to take the time
to listen and empathize with you.

187
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:11,838
But if all you do is vent about a problem,
you leave that conversation,

188
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,340
you feel great about the person
you just spoke to,

189
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,009
but the chatter is still churning

190
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,345
because you haven't done anything
to actually address it.

191
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:23,308
The best kinds of conversations
with other people do two things.

192
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:26,894
One, the person you're talking to
does let you express your emotions.

193
00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:29,188
It is important for them
to empathize with you

194
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:31,441
and validate what you're going through.

195
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:35,069
But then, once you've had an opportunity
to share your feelings,

196
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,906
they ideally start working with you
to broaden your perspective.

197
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:41,284
They're in an ideal position
to help you do that,

198
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:43,661
because the problem
isn't happening to them.

199
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:47,415
So think really carefully
about who your chatter advisors are.

200
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,877
They should be people
who both listen and advise.

201
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:54,380
That brings me to my third and final tool
that I want to share with you.

202
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:55,632
It's my favorite.

203
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,676
It's experiencing awe.

204
00:09:58,677 --> 00:09:59,886
About 10 years ago,

205
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:03,890
scientists at Berkeley tracked a group
of military veterans and first responders

206
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:07,727
as they paddled down
Utah's majestic Green River.

207
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:11,731
They measured participants' levels
of PTSD and stress,

208
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:14,776
mental states that are
infused with chatter,

209
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:17,779
both before and after the rafting trip.

210
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,990
Not surprisingly, they found
that most of the participants,

211
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:23,451
their stress and PTSD levels declined

212
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:26,162
from the beginning
to the end of the experiment.

213
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:28,665
But what was surprising was the factor

214
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,627
that predicted those declines
in PTSD and stress.

215
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:35,755
It was participants' experience of awe.

216
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:37,298
Awe is an emotion we experience

217
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:40,760
when we are in the presence
of something vast and indescribable.

218
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:43,930
Lots of people get it
from an amazing sunset.

219
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:45,556
I'm a science geek,

220
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:50,478
so I get it when I contemplate
outer space and interplanetary travel.

221
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:54,732
We have an SUV on Mars right now,
sending us footage back of that terrain --

222
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,026
that is awe-inspiring to me.

223
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:59,195
When we experience this emotion of awe,

224
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,698
it leads to what we call
a shrinking of the self.

225
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:06,994
We feel smaller when we're contemplating
something vast and indescribable,

226
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:10,957
and when we feel smaller,
so does our chatter.

227
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,459
I want to wrap things up
by sharing with you

228
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,505
a set of observations about our,
at times, messy emotional lives

229
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:21,509
that I find myself
thinking about quite a bit.

230
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,640
And every time I do, it fills me
with both dread, and I find it inspiring.

231
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,684
Between 8,000-10,000 years ago,

232
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:33,730
our ancestors invented
the first surgical technique.

233
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:35,398
Its name was trepanation,

234
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,736
and what it involved doing
was drilling holes in people's skulls.

235
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:43,406
One of the reasons why this technique
was believed to be used

236
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:46,200
was to help people
manage their emotions --

237
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,953
big, dysregulated emotional responses.

238
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:51,122
Let the evil spirits out.

239
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:53,040
Fast-forward to 1949.

240
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,794
A Portuguese physician
wins the Nobel Prize

241
00:11:56,795 --> 00:12:00,047
for another emotion
regulation intervention.

242
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:01,591
This one's name?

243
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:03,968
The frontal lobotomy.

244
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:10,266
We have come a long way, thankfully,
from carving holes in people's heads

245
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:13,019
and sticking ice picks
in our frontal cortices

246
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,021
to provide people with emotional relief.

247
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:20,902
Our toolbox of science-based skills
is vastly improved.

248
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:24,947
What we need to do a better job doing
is using these tools in our lives

249
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:26,991
and sharing them with other people.

250
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:30,411
We spend enormous amounts of resources

251
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:35,082
teaching ourselves how to communicate
more effectively with other people.

252
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,753
What we need to do is devote
an equivalent amount of resources

253
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:42,089
to teaching ourselves
how to communicate more effectively

254
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,508
with ourselves.

255
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:44,717
Thank you.

256
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:49,718
(Cheers and applause)
