1
00:00:00,788 --> 00:00:03,498
My first job out of college
was at Procter and Gamble,

2
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:04,791
first as a sales rep,

3
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:07,335
then a manager with three reps
reporting to me.

4
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:10,047
They were in their 40s, I was 26.

5
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:12,924
And frankly, I had no idea
how to be a manager.

6
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:16,011
I rode with them every two weeks,
visiting stores,

7
00:00:16,012 --> 00:00:18,889
yet rarely giving any feedback.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,265
I was in awe.

9
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:22,517
Then it came time for a year-end reviews.

10
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:26,688
I compiled a list of things
I thought each person could do to improve,

11
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,899
and I launched into my review with Rich.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,402
In about three minutes in, he cut me off.

13
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:34,112
"Hey, wait a minute, Joe.

14
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:36,823
You ride with me every two weeks,

15
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:39,284
and you've never said any of these things?

16
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:40,619
What the heck?"

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,704
I was mortified.

18
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,832
He taught me something in that moment.

19
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,502
Leadership isn't about role or position.

20
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:50,128
It's about generosity.

21
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,130
We need generous leaders,

22
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:57,260
those who give of themselves freely,
without expectation of personal gain,

23
00:00:57,261 --> 00:01:02,390
so others can develop, grow and thrive
at their full potential.

24
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:05,894
Now, since P and G, I've worked
across multiple roles at BCG,

25
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:07,395
the Boston Consulting Group,

26
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:10,357
overseeing teams of three people to 7,000.

27
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:13,485
I also had the privilege
of interviewing a number of executives

28
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:15,112
across many industries

29
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:17,030
for my book on generous leadership.

30
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:22,202
And let me tell you what a leader is
and what is demanded of them have changed.

31
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:26,748
We now want and need
to bring our human selves to work,

32
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:29,459
and we expect to see humanity
in our leaders.

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,877
But let me be very clear:

34
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:34,131
being generous is not
simply about being nice.

35
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:36,800
As Joaquin Duato,
CEO of Johnson and Johnson,

36
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,510
put it very plainly:

37
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,011
outcomes do matter.

38
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,972
A leader must get results.

39
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:44,599
But the sooner
they can look past themselves

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,519
and connect more deeply
and personally with their people,

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,106
and help unlock all the essential
human traits of their team,

42
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:54,192
the sooner they will drive
to those results.

43
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:56,653
So how do you be a generous leader?

44
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:59,781
There are seven traits
underpinning generous leadership.

45
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:02,367
Today I'd like to touch on three.

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,702
Tip number one:

47
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:06,621
Be curious, and listen generously.

48
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:08,915
No doubt you've heard this advice before,

49
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,209
and maybe you consider yourself
a good listener.

50
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,544
But let me ask you this.

51
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:16,840
To whom are you listening?
The senior team? Your own leadership team?

52
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,802
How about your direct report's
direct report's direct report?

53
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:24,431
Have you asked your assistant
for their insights?

54
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:27,893
Generous listeners
ignore the traditional barriers

55
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,603
of titles and hierarchy.

56
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:32,689
They ask and listen. They listen to learn.

57
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,692
And with that respect,
they inspire others.

58
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:38,820
Take Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines.

59
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:42,073
Anytime someone is getting promoted
to an officer position at United,

60
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:44,451
he schedules a one-on-one
interview with him.

61
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,453
Can you imagine how rare that is?

62
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,581
CEO interviewing every VP candidate?

63
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:51,416
When I interviewed Scott for my book,

64
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:53,627
he recalled sitting down
with three candidates

65
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:55,545
for vice president of operations.

66
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,464
Each started as technicians,

67
00:02:57,465 --> 00:03:00,425
the people out on the tarmac
doing maintenance every day

68
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:03,720
to keep passengers safe
and the planes on time.

69
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:08,016
It is a critical function,
but many, many layers away from the CEO.

70
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:10,644
But Scott was still
curious enough to ask them,

71
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,687
"What do technicians need most?"

72
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:15,065
And each of those candidates
said the same thing.

73
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:18,568
"Sir, we don't have
enough spare parts on site."

74
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,946
Scott said, "That was
such an epiphany for me.

75
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:24,407
Our technicians on the front line,
of course, want to do well,

76
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:26,743
but when they don't have
the spare parts on hand,

77
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:28,536
they can't do their job with pride."

78
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:31,498
So while Scott knew the financial people
would not be pleased,

79
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,875
he said, "I increased parts in the airport

80
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:36,962
as I believe supporting the pride
in our technicians

81
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:39,005
would pay big dividends."

82
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:42,884
Asking and listening
helps you better solve tough challenges,

83
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:45,470
but crucially, it shows respect.

84
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:50,141
It tells the person you see them
as a human with valuable insights.

85
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:54,145
Tip number two:
Be vulnerable. Put down the mask.

86
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,939
Easier said than done, I fear.

87
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,274
When I was a young leader,

88
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:59,567
I felt so much pressure
to have all the answers.

89
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:01,569
It never occurred to me to be vulnerable.

90
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,905
I'm not even sure I knew
what the word meant.

91
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:07,242
And even today, many wonder,
what does it mean?

92
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:08,576
Well, here's an example.

93
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:11,871
I was talking with a colleague
about his own vulnerabilities.

94
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:14,874
He said that if he sensed
his team was getting lost

95
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,002
and they might ask him what to do,

96
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:19,087
and he also didn't know what to do,

97
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:22,007
he would literally get up
and leave the room

98
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,968
rather than say, "I don't know."

99
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:26,469
Real productive, huh?

100
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,639
Finally, one day he thought,
"This is silly."

101
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,268
He stayed in the room and he admitted,
"I don't know either."

102
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,395
And he was astonished
at what happened next.

103
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,897
The room had erupted
with energy and ideas.

104
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:39,733
Since the boss didn't know,

105
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:43,653
it was OK for everyone
to move past their fear, their roadblocks,

106
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:48,158
acknowledge their own vulnerability,
and get to work figuring it out.

107
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,619
Tip number three:
Be generous in the moment.

108
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,915
In every moment, especially when
there's nothing for you to gain.

109
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,418
That's the true definition of generosity.

110
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,753
I was talking to a leader

111
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:02,130
of one of the most
prestigious firms in the world.

112
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:04,549
He recalled sitting
in a gorgeous conference room

113
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,926
with a view of the city that doesn't quit,

114
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:12,015
with nine other leaders deciding
the fate of today's young interviewees.

115
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:14,768
First candidate. Great interview scores.

116
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:19,314
Super grades, solid resume. She's in.

117
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:20,648
Number two.

118
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:24,069
Average across the board. That's a no.

119
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,946
Number three knocked it
out of the park on the interviews.

120
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:28,823
Top scores across the board.

121
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:32,077
"Wow," someone said,
"We don't see this very often."

122
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:34,162
"Wait a minute," another person spoke up.

123
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:37,457
"He has a mid 2.0 college GPA.

124
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:41,086
We know people in that grade range
just don't last here."

125
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:42,754
Conversation went back and forth.

126
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:46,883
Got a bit heated,
but the mood swung to a no.

127
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:48,176
And then my friend,

128
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:52,305
who had been sitting there silently,
biding his time, just listening,

129
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:54,140
spoke up.

130
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:58,436
"I have to tell you all something
I've never told anyone here before.

131
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:00,939
I had those grades in college.

132
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,690
What can I say? I wasn't focused.

133
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,776
But you know what? I got my act together.

134
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:06,152
Got into business school.

135
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:09,656
Got hired here, made senior partner,

136
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:12,283
and now I'm the head of this office.

137
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:15,703
What do you say we give
this young man a chance, too?"

138
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:19,457
Now this is a lovely story,
but here's why it's interesting.

139
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,252
Because it didn't matter whatsoever
to this executive

140
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:24,254
if this young man was hired.

141
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,548
There were plenty of other candidates.

142
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:30,468
Why would he make this vulnerable
admission to save a mere stranger?

143
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:33,680
Because that's what it means
to be generous in the moment.

144
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:36,558
To take each and every opportunity you get

145
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:40,562
to help others grow
and thrive at their full potential,

146
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:43,523
even when you personally
have nothing to gain.

147
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:46,818
Generosity is what will move you
from the good manager category

148
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,403
to an exceptional leader.

149
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:51,614
Your people are not only motivated
by your dazzling strategies,

150
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:55,702
your brilliant plans,
your inspiring targets and metrics.

151
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:59,164
When they see you bring
your full heart into your leadership

152
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:01,332
and share your humanity,

153
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,628
that is when they will
follow you anywhere.

154
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,629
Thank you for listening.
