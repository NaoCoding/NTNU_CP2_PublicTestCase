00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:19,448
(Applause)

2
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:20,850
NEO: As a species,

3
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:23,386
humans have mastered energy
to the level where it is,

4
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:26,422
for all practical purposes,
completely abundant.

5
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:27,857
200 years ago,

6
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:31,260
no one could have imagined a world
where energy was so accessible

7
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,896
that most people
would take it for granted.

8
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:36,065
If you had asked the smartest
person on Earth

9
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:39,702
whether we could one day summon light
with the flip of a switch,

10
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:41,604
they would have said it was impossible.

11
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:45,374
Even if the brightest minds
worked on it together for an eternity.

12
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,443
But today, it's just that easy.

13
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:48,644
Energy is everywhere.

14
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:51,047
All around us, all of the time.

15
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:54,517
Now what if I told you that the same
is about to happen with labor?

16
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:56,953
We are standing at the gates of a future

17
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:00,022
where the work needed
to build the products we use,

18
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:01,857
the services we rely on

19
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:05,361
and even the chores in our homes
will be as effortlessly accessible

20
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:06,996
as energy is today,

21
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:09,365
enabling you to explore new frontiers

22
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:12,935
and focus on what makes you truly human.

23
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:19,475
Thank you.

24
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:24,714
(Applause)

25
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:26,215
Bernt Børnich: Thank you, NEO.

26
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:30,820
You're the best.

27
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:33,155
It's an amazing machine, right?

28
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:34,323
Audience: Yeah.

29
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:37,927
(Applause)

30
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:40,863
BB: So I spent the last decade of my life

31
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,734
working on building
humanoid robots like NEO.

32
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:47,937
Robots that will hopefully
soon be able to do

33
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:50,840
almost anything that we could imagine.

34
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,943
Now whether this is
helping you with the dishes,

35
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:55,478
helping you do your laundry

36
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,515
or whether this is helping
your aging grandma,

37
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:03,519
there's never really been a time
better for robots.

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,922
We have an aging population
in need of help,

39
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:09,725
and we have a large labor shortage

40
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:12,695
across most of the global economy.

41
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:14,497
And there's much, much more.

42
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:20,603
But even more importantly,
to me, these robots,

43
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:22,104
they promise something greater

44
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:25,341
than just the ability
to solve the problems of today.

45
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:28,210
They can solve things
that we cannot do today.

46
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:31,747
They can give us back things like time.

47
00:02:31,748 --> 00:02:38,354
And as these systems and AIs
now become both physical and agentic,

48
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:41,057
we can start to work towards a future

49
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:45,227
where we actually have
an abundance of labor.

50
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:48,864
We can start towards lifting humanity
out of this constant battle

51
00:02:48,865 --> 00:02:51,233
over scarcity of resources,

52
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:54,437
and create a world where
everyone has what they need.

53
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:56,472
And I think that will, to some extent,

54
00:02:56,473 --> 00:03:02,144
actually redefine
what it means to be human.

55
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:05,648
But since I'd say, around year 1400,

56
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:08,784
when Leonardo da Vinci
made "The Mechanical Man,"

57
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:12,121
that to me is kind of like the first
example of a humanoid robot,

58
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:18,961
these things have been mainly a thing
of science fiction, not reality.

59
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:20,629
But this is changing.

60
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,065
The robots, they're actually here.

61
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:26,669
And when I say here,
I don't necessarily mean in videos.

62
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,804
They're actually here in our homes.

63
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,440
At least if you work at 1X, where I work,

64
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:35,277
where we now have them in quite
a few homes throughout the company.

65
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:37,880
And already later this year,

66
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:40,382
I hope some of you guys
will have it in your home

67
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:43,452
and join us on this journey.

68
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:47,790
So that means NEO is now part
of my daily routine.

69
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,659
So it does some of the chores
around the house.

70
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,194
Some of this is autonomous.

71
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:54,430
Some of this is done
through remote operation

72
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:55,965
as it's learning.

73
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,433
And I talk to it.

74
00:03:57,434 --> 00:04:00,202
I treat it kind of like a butler,
like a companion.

75
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:02,037
It's part of the family.

76
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:04,673
And I think it's actually
incredibly interesting

77
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:07,676
to also see how this social
dynamic develops,

78
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:10,212
because this is, of course,
incredibly useful and fun

79
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,815
to have it do stuff
I don't want to do around my home.

80
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:15,417
But it's also really fun
to see the beginning of like,

81
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:19,822
what will this relationship be
between man and machine

82
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:23,159
as these AIs become physical.

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,197
Now like I said,
the hardware is actually here.

84
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:32,168
It took us about a decade
of very hard work,

85
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,837
but also many people that came before us,

86
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:37,606
a lot of time to do
the foundational research

87
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:40,943
for us to now finally
be able to build a machine

88
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:44,880
that can do almost anything
that a human can do.

89
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:47,416
But it begs the big question, of course:

90
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:50,119
When will they be fully autonomous?

91
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,456
When will they actually
become truly intelligent?

92
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:59,528
And what is the path
that will actually take us there?

93
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:05,134
And I think this will be very
obvious in [retrospect].

94
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:07,002
They need to live and learn among us.

95
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:10,339
We actually need to take these machines,
and we need to adopt them.

96
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,711
We need to put them into our society
and let them learn just as we do.

97
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:18,147
So the general convention has been,

98
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:20,616
or general wisdom, that robots,

99
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:23,018
they're going to first
happen in factories.

100
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,387
So we're going to put
these robots into factories,

101
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:29,692
they're going to do the dull, repetitive,
dangerous tasks that they're good at.

102
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:34,029
And as they do these repetitive tasks,
they get better and better, right?

103
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,631
They get more intelligent.

104
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:39,201
And after some time,
we can put them into our home.

105
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:40,970
They will be able to do our laundry,

106
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:43,272
they will build our skyscrapers.

107
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:47,543
But this is actually categorically wrong.

108
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:50,613
And we know because
we actually tried that.

109
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:53,349
So back in 2022,

110
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,986
we took our previous generation
wheeled humanoid, Eve,

111
00:05:56,987 --> 00:05:59,922
and we put it in industry.

112
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,824
And it actually went really well.

113
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:05,694
We solved a lot of kind
of narrow, specific tasks,

114
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:08,197
and it got really good
at them really fast.

115
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:11,934
And then after about 20 to 50 hours,

116
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,371
the robots, they just stopped learning.

117
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:18,807
And if you think about it,
it's not really rocket science.

118
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,278
Because if you’re doing the same
task over and over every day,

119
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,046
and it's the only thing you're doing,

120
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:26,048
you're not going to get very intelligent.

121
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,516
There's no information there.

122
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:30,753
And also you're going to generally become
very narrow-minded, right?

123
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:33,122
We don't like being narrow-minded.

124
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:35,557
And if you think about like,
what is a factory?

125
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:42,197
It is essentially a process that we design
to reduce diversity and variance.

126
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:46,535
You want your factory worker
to need as little information as possible

127
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:47,970
to be able to do the job

128
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:52,241
and get a high-quality,
repeatable product out.

129
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:56,378
And this is kind of the opposite
of what you need for intelligence.

130
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,013
You need diversity,

131
00:06:58,014 --> 00:06:59,815
you need to challenge yourself.

132
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:03,552
You need to do new tasks every day
that you don't know how to do.

133
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,988
And there's a great parallel here

134
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:09,491
to the early days
of large language models.

135
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:12,394
So when we use these models today,

136
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:15,130
and they're getting really good,

137
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:17,933
we kind of forget where they started.

138
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:22,171
They started with a lot of people
trying to make very narrow models.

139
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:23,605
So if I take an example,

140
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:28,944
if you wanted to make a very good
writing assistant to write poetry,

141
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:32,348
then you would, of course train
on all of the best poetry in the world.

142
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:33,549
Make sense.

143
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,150
And then it wouldn't really work.

144
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:40,656
And when we started training these models
on all of the internet, right,

145
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:45,527
the complete diversity
of all human knowledge,

146
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:46,729
they started working.

147
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,197
They became kind of smart.

148
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:51,367
They started being able to,
to a certain extent, to reason.

149
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:55,170
And I'd say like,
understand to a certain extent,

150
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:58,841
what is the question you’re asking
and how should I answer.

151
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:01,977
And this is also how we humans learn.

152
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:04,747
We need a large amount of diversity

153
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,783
for us to be able to develop
into intelligent beings.

154
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:10,886
So why should it be different for robots?

155
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:13,188
And it really begs the question then:

156
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:16,525
What is the equivalent of the internet?

157
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:20,629
How do we find this kind of like
internet-level diversity of information

158
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,498
for our robots?

159
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:28,003
Well we come to the conclusion
that this is probably the home.

160
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:31,940
Now the home is this
beautiful, chaotic thing.

161
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:37,546
It's kind of like the messiness
that is being human.

162
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:39,548
And I want to take a small example here.

163
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,950
So think about a cup.

164
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:44,153
Now of course, there's
many cups in the world,

165
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:46,955
and you want to be able to figure out
how all of them work.

166
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:49,858
But even if you look at one specific cup,

167
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,860
it can be so many things.

168
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,695
Is it dirty? Is it clean?

169
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:55,364
It's kind of in the middle?

170
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:56,732
Is it on the table,

171
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,101
in the cabinet, on the floor?

172
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,969
It can even have a social context.

173
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,337
Someone's using the cup.

174
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:03,806
Someone's waiting for the cup.

175
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:05,741
Like, why is the cup even there?

176
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:07,342
And this is just a cup.

177
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:09,812
Now think about expanding this
out into everything

178
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,781
and every object and everything
going on in your home.

179
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:15,317
That's the kind of diversity
that we're talking about

180
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:18,687
to get to proper machine intelligence.

181
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:22,391
So like any good scientist, right,

182
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:27,129
we had this hypothesis,
and now we have to test it.

183
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,533
So in 2023, we brought our robots home.

184
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:34,169
And I had Eve in my house
for quite a while.

185
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,738
And it was, of course,
doing the standard things

186
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:38,640
like emptying the dishwasher,

187
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:40,476
but also bringing me a cup of tea

188
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:43,212
when I was enjoying playing
board games with my friends

189
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:46,748
or serving cupcakes
at my daughter's birthday party.

190
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:49,918
And pretty quickly,

191
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,357
it actually became quite clear
that this hypothesis

192
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:57,559
actually was the ground truth.

193
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,661
The home is this incredible,

194
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:01,263
diverse source of data

195
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:05,000
that lets us continue
to progress intelligence.

196
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:09,571
So we thought originally
that it was going to be this,

197
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:12,007
but actually it was this.

198
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:22,618
And let me show you guys now
how this actually works in practice.

199
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:27,556
Oh thank you NEO,
you’re doing a good job.

200
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,757
It's a bit noisy,

201
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,093
but hopefully you can still hear me.

202
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:32,995
What you see here now,

203
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:35,631
of course, is just a subset
of tasks that NEO can do.

204
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:38,734
And this is a mix of autonomy,

205
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:40,903
for things the robot is good at,

206
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,272
and some remote operation

207
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:45,007
where someone's guiding the robot

208
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:49,878
to basically do expert demonstrations
on how to do these tasks.

209
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,016
And as we have an increasing
number of these robots

210
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:56,218
throughout homes,

211
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:58,287
living among us and learning,

212
00:10:58,288 --> 00:11:01,256
more and more of this becomes autonomous

213
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:02,457
until hopefully,

214
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,396
one day, all of this
will be fully autonomous.

215
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:12,568
And if you kind of
follow along in the field,

216
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,370
a natural question to ask
at this point would be:

217
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:17,940
Why doesn’t everyone do this?

218
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,808
If it's so obvious.

219
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:24,346
Well it actually turns out,
it’s incredibly hard

220
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:28,517
to make a robot that is safe among people.

221
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:35,624
So robots are traditionally
these quite stiff, high-energy --

222
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,261
you’re doing great, NEO,
you’re doing great.

223
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:41,129
They're this --

224
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,233
careful, I don’t want to get watered --

225
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:47,169
stiff machines that are
high-energy and dangerous.

226
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,239
And this is very different
from how NEO works.

227
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,008
NEO actually has tendons
that [get] pulled,

228
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,644
very loosely inspired by human muscle.

229
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:59,281
And this makes NEO
into a robot that is quiet, soft,

230
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:02,017
compliant, lightweight, safe,

231
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:08,757
and really able to live
among us and learn among us.

232
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:10,792
Let's see if he figures it out.

233
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:12,094
It's a hard one.

234
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:17,065
You can do it, NEO.

235
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:22,004
(Applause)

236
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:32,481
I said he's the best, right?

237
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:33,849
OK.

238
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,687
So this is still,
of course, incredibly early.

239
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:42,658
We're all the way
in the beginning of this journey.

240
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,528
But I do hope that, in not so long,

241
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,764
just like we take energy
for granted around us,

242
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:51,667
we will be able to take
labor around us for granted.

243
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:54,870
And we might soon
not even remember the day

244
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:57,739
where there wasn't always like,
a helping hand available

245
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,342
for anything we wanted to do.

246
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:05,180
But as these machines go
around in our society and learn,

247
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:08,083
to me this journey is about a lot more

248
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:12,354
than just you not having
to do your laundry.

249
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:16,258
It's about creating a future
where we actually have time

250
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,728
to focus on what matters to us as humans,

251
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:22,597
and getting rid of these constraints.

252
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:27,903
But also, it's an opportunity
to really have these machines

253
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:32,574
help us solve some of the outstanding
questions that we still have.

254
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:38,080
Like, can we have robots build robots?

255
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:43,852
Can we have robots build
data centers to progress AI?

256
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:46,121
Can we have robots that build chip fabs

257
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:49,858
to help us accelerate adoption of AI?

258
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:53,495
And I think it's getting pretty clear
that we can have all of these things.

259
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:56,832
But it goes even further than that.

260
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,502
I hope we can get a future
where we have humanoid robots like Neo

261
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:03,105
that is actually building
particle accelerators,

262
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:04,940
that is building labs.

263
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:09,044
We will have millions of robots
around in the world doing high-quality,

264
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:11,279
repetitive experiments in labs

265
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,682
and helping us progress science

266
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:16,518
at a pace that we have never seen before.

267
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,587
And I hope that in the future,

268
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:22,791
through this kind of like a symbiosis
between man and machine,

269
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,760
we can start trying to answer

270
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:28,397
some of the remaining
big unanswered questions

271
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:31,466
about the universe and our role here.

272
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:32,934
And I think if we can do that,

273
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:37,105
that will to some extent redefine
what it means to be human.

274
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:38,273
Thank you.

275
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:43,274
(Applause)
