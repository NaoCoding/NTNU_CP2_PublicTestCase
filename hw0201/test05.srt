1
00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:02,414
Picture a boardroom in China.

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:03,665
What do you see?

3
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:05,959
Well, big changes are coming.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,169
In the next decade,

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,922
you will start to see much younger
faces filling up these spaces.

6
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,884
I'm not just talking about China's
international giants.

7
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:18,096
I’m talking about China’s small-
and medium-sized local businesses.

8
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:21,516
With 100 to 500 million
US dollars in revenue.

9
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:25,187
There are local giants in beverage,
snacks or fashion.

10
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:26,396
As we speak,

11
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:28,857
there are 50-, 60- and 
70-year-old founders

12
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:31,485
who are getting ready
for a boardroom transition.

13
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:34,654
And a whole new generation
will rise to power.

14
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:36,823
Why does this matter, you might ask.

15
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:40,619
Because competition is only
about to get fiercer in China,

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,288
and the new masterminds
behind these businesses

17
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,375
are also eager to take their family
businesses onto the global stage.

18
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:48,585
I live in China.

19
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,963
I spent the last 10 years
consulting with Chinese companies,

20
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:54,966
and I've worked with over 50 chairpersons.

21
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:57,636
From my conversations with them
and the broader data,

22
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:00,263
I can tell you that those local players

23
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:04,267
are gradually gaining market share
across many industries.

24
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:08,188
So why are these local companies
suddenly more competitive?

25
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,818
One big reason is that these new leaders
look nothing like their parents.

26
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,487
They grew up with greater
access to the internet.

27
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:20,742
They left China to study business
in the US, the UK, Australia,

28
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:22,786
Canada and Singapore.

29
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:24,162
They are multilingual.

30
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:25,831
They have advanced degrees.

31
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:29,292
They can tap into their vast networks
of professional services,

32
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:31,294
private equity and venture capital.

33
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:35,841
And now they are coming home
to take over their family businesses,

34
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:38,385
catapult them onto the world stage

35
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:41,888
and change the face
of business in China forever.

36
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:43,807
Here is what you can expect.

37
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:48,395
Number one, fewer copycats
and more innovation.

38
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:50,522
In the 1970s and '80s,

39
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:53,400
many entrepreneurs were cash-strapped.

40
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,860
To succeed fast,

41
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:59,072
let's just say imitation
was the sincerest form of flattery.

42
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:01,533
If you saw someone selling energy drink,

43
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,535
you'd launch your own energy drink.

44
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:08,456
However, this new generation knows
that copycatting is a dead-end model.

45
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:11,710
They are figuring out
how to kickstart innovation in-house

46
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:13,128
through competition.

47
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:14,546
For example,

48
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:18,925
I worked with a snack company
who was struggling with sluggish sales.

49
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:22,596
Their research and development
process was just not working.

50
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:25,015
They developed a lot of new flavors

51
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:27,350
but nothing truly innovative.

52
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:31,271
Until the second generation came up
with a surprising idea.

53
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:35,233
They split this large R and D team
into two smaller teams

54
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:37,110
to compete against each other.

55
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:41,031
The team with the winning product
would get a share of profits.

56
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:43,950
When one of the teams
talked with their consumers,

57
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:46,578
they realized there is an unmet need.

58
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,706
Their beef jerky packaging
was difficult to open,

59
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:52,584
and the beef was too long and too tough.

60
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:56,504
The consumer felt self-conscious
eating it in public or at work.

61
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:59,007
So the team redesigned the packaging

62
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:02,219
and made the jerky smaller and softer.

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,387
This design won the blind test

64
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:06,264
and was launched to the market,

65
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:08,391
where it enjoyed great sales,

66
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:11,853
especially in the company's
original flavor jerky.

67
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:15,023
And the winning team got
five percent of all the profits

68
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:16,858
that exceeded the original target.

69
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,694
Since the new generation
launched this new system,

70
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:22,239
new products have generated
over 40 percent

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,783
of the company's annual sales revenue.

72
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:26,076
Number two,

73
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:29,120
smart investments in bold ideas.

74
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:33,124
Many first-generation entrepreneurs
in China succeeded through grit,

75
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:37,003
through experience and through
keen market intuition.

76
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:40,799
They didn't have an MBA
or professional team to fall back on.

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,009
When it came to making big decisions,

78
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,303
they often went with their gut.

79
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:48,682
Of course, failure wasn't
a bad teacher either,

80
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:52,519
but this new generation can think
like an objective investor.

81
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,230
I worked with a plant-based
beverage company

82
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:58,441
whose founder had always sold
their drinks to restaurants,

83
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:00,652
never direct to consumer.

84
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:05,115
But when COVID hit the restaurants,
their sales plummeted.

85
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:08,076
The second generation knew
they needed a change,

86
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:09,911
even if change was hard.

87
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:13,331
So she first founded
an investment committee

88
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:17,919
and then announced open auditions
to fund new business ideas.

89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,338
The winning idea would get funding,

90
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,049
but financial performance
would be quarterly reviewed

91
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,676
by the investment committee.

92
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:28,722
One sales manager suggested
switching from large glass bottles

93
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,974
to smaller paper carton packaging.

94
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:34,644
They'd market them to mothers
as a nutritious breakfast drink

95
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:38,648
with kid-friendly flavors
like sesame, like jasmine.

96
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:41,234
When it launched, within three months,

97
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:44,237
the new drink ranked
into the top three plant-based milks

98
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,323
on major e-commerce platforms.

99
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:48,491
With this investor mindset,

100
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:54,497
the new generation is helping team members
become the CEO of their own ideas.

101
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:55,874
And number three,

102
00:04:55,875 --> 00:05:00,086
businesses will expand
into the entire ecosystem.

103
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:01,921
In an age of scarcity,

104
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:05,425
first-generation entrepreneurs
focused on doing one thing

105
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:06,926
and doing it right.

106
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:09,721
But the new generation
grew up with internet giants

107
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:12,599
who have built massive digital ecosystems:

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,102
vast interconnected
networks of e-commerce,

109
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:20,065
logistics, social media, payment, etc.

110
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,733
They don't just do one thing,

111
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,693
they do nearly everything.

112
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:25,904
I worked with a livestock producer

113
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:30,075
whose founder focused on rearing
the highest quality pork and poultry,

114
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,826
and they were very successful.

115
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:35,955
But the second generation is thinking
way bigger than raising livestock.

116
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:39,334
It's only the first step
in a very long value chain.

117
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:40,960
What if they expanded downstream?

118
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:42,712
They could get into meat processing

119
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:45,507
and develop their own line of sliced ham,

120
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:47,258
sausage and jerky.

121
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,762
They could even invest in companies
that buy their meat products,

122
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:52,138
like dumpling brands.

123
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,265
By thinking about the entire ecosystem,

124
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:57,685
from farming to food and even to retail,

125
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:59,771
they can simplify the supply chain,

126
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:04,025
spend less, earn more and expand faster.

127
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:06,820
All three of these examples
show what's possible

128
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:10,615
when the future second-generation leaders
take over Chinese businesses.

129
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:12,742
They’re not just looking to imitate

130
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:15,870
but to create and lead
their own ecosystems

131
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:18,623
and be bullish on every
growth opportunity.

132
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:21,626
These new leaders don't shy away
from competition.

133
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:23,753
In fact, they embrace it

134
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:27,006
and push change vertically and laterally.

135
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,759
And they don't take no for an answer.

136
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,553
To compete internationally,

137
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:35,223
we might even see a new wave
of major multinational companies

138
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:36,891
emerge from China.

139
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:38,101
So don't be surprised

140
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:42,105
when China's boardrooms have
a lot less gray hair in the coming years.

141
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:45,817
China's future has never
looked more colorful.

142
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:50,818
Thank you.
