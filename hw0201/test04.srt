1
00:00:00,788 --> 00:00:02,539
So a couple of years ago,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,542
a woman I know who I'll call Maya,

3
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:08,712
went through a lot of big changes
in a short amount of time.

4
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:09,921
She got married.

5
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:12,591
She and her husband moved
for his job to a new city

6
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:14,301
where she didn’t know anyone.

7
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:16,928
She started a new role working from home,

8
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:21,183
all while managing her dad's
new diagnosis of dementia.

9
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:24,102
And to manage the stress
of all this change,

10
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:27,481
Maya doubled down on her physical
and mental health.

11
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:29,316
She exercised almost every day,

12
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:30,734
she ate healthy foods,

13
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,819
she went to therapy once a week.

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,488
And these actions really helped.

15
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,198
Her body got stronger.

16
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:40,827
Her mind got more resilient,
but only up to a point.

17
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:42,370
She was still struggling,

18
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:45,290
often losing sleep
in the middle of the night,

19
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,793
feeling unfocused,
unmotivated during the day.

20
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:51,546
Maya was doing everything
that doctors typically tell us to do

21
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:54,257
to be physically and mentally healthy,

22
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:57,552
and yet something was missing.

23
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:00,472
What if I told you
that what was missing for Maya

24
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:04,434
is also missing for billions
of people around the world,

25
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:07,354
and that it might be missing for you?

26
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:11,399
What if I told you that not having it
undermines our other efforts

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,446
to be healthy and can even
shorten your lifespan?

28
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,698
I’ve been studying this for over a decade,

29
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:21,743
and I've discovered
that the traditional way we think

30
00:01:21,744 --> 00:01:24,955
about health is incomplete.

31
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:28,750
By thinking of our health
as primarily physical and mental,

32
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:32,337
we overlook what I believe
is the greatest challenge

33
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:35,799
and the greatest opportunity of our time.

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,176
Social health.

35
00:01:38,177 --> 00:01:40,804
While physical health is about our bodies

36
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,973
and mental health is about our minds,

37
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:47,144
social health is about our relationships.

38
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,187
And if you haven't heard this term before,

39
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:53,233
that's because it hasn't yet
made its way into mainstream vocabulary,

40
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:56,653
yet it is equally important.

41
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:59,948
Maya didn't yet have a sense
of community in her new home.

42
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:01,741
She wasn't seeing her family,

43
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:04,828
or her friends or her coworkers
in person anymore,

44
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,540
and she often went weeks only spending
quality time with her husband.

45
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:12,961
Her story shows us
that we can't be fully healthy,

46
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:16,965
we can’t thrive, if we take
care of our bodies and our minds,

47
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:20,218
but not our relationships.

48
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,803
Similar to Maya,

49
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:25,891
hundreds of millions of people
around the world go weeks at a time

50
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:30,770
without talking to a single friend
or family member.

51
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:34,983
Globally, one in four people feel lonely.

52
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:39,070
And 20 percent of adults worldwide
don't feel like they have anyone

53
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,740
they can reach out to for support.

54
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,241
Think about that.

55
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:48,872
One in five people you encounter
may feel like they have no one.

56
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:51,458
This is more than heartbreaking.

57
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,044
It's also a public health crisis.

58
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:56,713
Disconnection triggers stress in the body.

59
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:59,424
It weakens people's immune systems.

60
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:04,554
It puts them at a risk, greater risk,
of stroke, heart disease, diabetes,

61
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:08,141
dementia, depression and early death.

62
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:12,520
Social health is essential for longevity.

63
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,939
So you might be wondering,

64
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,358
what does it look like
to be socially healthy?

65
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:18,026
What does that even mean?

66
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:20,946
Well it’s about developing
close relationships

67
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:25,075
with your family, your friends,
your partner, yourself.

68
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:29,412
It's about having regular interaction
with your coworkers, your neighbors.

69
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:32,749
It's about feeling like
you belong to a community.

70
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,628
Being socially healthy is about
having the right quantity

71
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,340
and quality of connection for you.

72
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,175
And Maya's story is one example

73
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:44,719
of how social health challenges come up.

74
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,097
In my work, I hear many others.

75
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:48,556
Stories like Jay,

76
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:49,975
a freshman in college

77
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,644
who’s eager to get involved in campus

78
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:55,522
yet is having a hard time
fitting in with people in his dorm

79
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:57,649
and often feels homesick.

80
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,528
Or Serena and Ali, a couple
juggling the chaos of young kids

81
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:03,113
with demanding jobs,

82
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,906
they rarely have time to see friends

83
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:07,492
or spend time one-on-one.

84
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:09,661
Or Henry, recently retired,

85
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:11,955
who cherishes time with his spouse

86
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:15,458
and yet feels untethered
without his team anymore

87
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,962
and wishes he could see his kids
and grandkids more often.

88
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:23,717
These stories show that social health
is relevant to each of us

89
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:26,261
at every life stage.

90
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:28,221
So if you're not sure where to start,

91
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:31,057
try the 5-3-1 guideline from my book.

92
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:32,392
It goes like this.

93
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:35,979
Aim to interact with five
different people each week,

94
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,025
to strengthen at least three
close relationships overall,

95
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,944
and to spend one hour a day connecting.

96
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,696
Let's dig into these.

97
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:48,575
So first, interact with five
different people each week.

98
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,994
Just like eating a variety of vegetables

99
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:53,580
and other food groups is more nutritious,

100
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:57,042
research has shown that interacting
with a variety of people

101
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,376
is more rewarding.

102
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:02,339
So your five could include close
loved ones, casual acquaintances,

103
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,631
even complete strangers.

104
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:05,842
In fact, in one study that I love,

105
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:08,261
people who just smiled, made eye contact

106
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,221
and chit-chatted with a barista,

107
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,932
felt happier and a greater
sense of belonging

108
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,561
than people who just rushed
to get their coffee and go.

109
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:20,732
Next, strengthen at least
three close relationships.

110
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:23,151
OK, we've all heard of a to-do list,

111
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:27,822
but I would like to invite you
to write a to-love list.

112
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:29,699
Who matters most to you?

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,826
Who can you be yourself with?

114
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:33,536
Make sure that you invest

115
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:37,165
in the names of at least three
of the people that you write down.

116
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,292
By scheduling regular time together,

117
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:42,045
by showing a genuine interest
in their lives,

118
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:43,421
and also by opening up

119
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:46,132
about the experiences
that you're going through.

120
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,718
And I'm often asked,
does it have to be in person?

121
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:50,804
Does texting count?

122
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:53,264
Studies have shown
that face-to-face is ideal,

123
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,808
so do that whenever possible.

124
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:59,396
But there are absolutely still benefits
to staying connected virtually.

125
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:03,983
And last, spend one hour a day
on meaningful connection.

126
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:07,237
OK, if you're an introvert,
right now you're probably thinking

127
00:06:07,238 --> 00:06:09,989
one hour sounds like a lot.

128
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,199
I get it.

129
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,286
It might be surprising,
but I'm actually also an introvert.

130
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:19,374
However, keep in mind that just like
getting eight hours of sleep at night,

131
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,085
the exact amount
that's right for you personally

132
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:24,754
might be higher or lower.

133
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:28,550
But if you are thinking that one hour
a day sounds like way too much

134
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,510
because you're just way too busy,

135
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:32,345
I challenge you.

136
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:35,390
Adults in the US spend
an average of 4.5 hours

137
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,851
each day on their smartphones.

138
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:40,353
So instead of scrolling on social media,

139
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:42,439
text a friend.

140
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,818
Instead of reading news headlines,
write a thank-you card.

141
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:51,448
Instead of listening to a podcast,
call a family member.

142
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,158
Maya put this into practice

143
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,537
by scheduling recurring hangouts
with a new local friend that she made,

144
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:00,915
by attending community events

145
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:04,169
and dropping cards off
in her neighbors mailboxes,

146
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,753
by planning trips to see family

147
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:08,590
and inviting friends
in other cities to come visit.

148
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:11,843
And bolstering her social health

149
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:13,178
made more of a difference

150
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:18,141
than focusing solely on her physical
and mental health ever could.

151
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:21,644
And I know this because Maya

152
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:25,315
is actually me.

153
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:29,027
I am so passionate about sharing tools
to be socially healthy

154
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:31,196
because honestly, I need them too.

155
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:35,283
And the 5-3-1 guideline is one way
that we can be proactive

156
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:38,203
and intentional about our relationships.

157
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,871
And that is really the point.

158
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:45,043
Be proactive and intentional
about your social health.

159
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:50,173
So zooming out beyond the steps
that you and I take individually,

160
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:54,594
together, we need to shape a society
that thrives through social health.

161
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:55,803
Over the next decade,

162
00:07:55,804 --> 00:07:59,766
I envision educators
championing social health in schools.

163
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:03,436
And just like kids build
their physical muscles in gym class,

164
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:07,732
they'll exercise their social muscles
in connection class.

165
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:08,900
Over the next decade,

166
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,402
I see our cities and neighborhoods

167
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:14,072
being designed with social health in mind,

168
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:16,908
where vibrant gathering
places foster unity

169
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:21,204
and community builders are empowered
to bring them to life.

170
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:22,413
Over the next decade,

171
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,123
I believe that social health

172
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:27,835
will become as ingrained
in our collective consciousness

173
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:29,879
as mental health is today.

174
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,130
Because not that long ago,

175
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:34,842
mental health was a taboo topic
shrouded in stigma.

176
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:37,554
And now public figures
talk openly about it,

177
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:40,723
there's an entire industry to support it,

178
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:43,184
and more and more people
think of going to therapy

179
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:45,687
like going to the gym.

180
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:49,023
In this future, loneliness will subside,

181
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,568
just like smoking subsided
when we recognized

182
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:54,988
and treated it as a public health issue.

183
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,531
In this future,

184
00:08:56,532 --> 00:09:00,243
I hope that social health
will become so deeply woven

185
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:02,120
into the fabric of our culture

186
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:06,332
that no one needs
the 5-3-1 guideline anymore.

187
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,376
So to get there,

188
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:12,380
make relationships
your priority not only for you,

189
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:14,424
but also for the people you love.

190
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:18,094
Because the beauty of nurturing
your own social health

191
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,597
is that it naturally enriches
the social health

192
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:23,349
of everyone you connect with.

193
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,517
Thank you.

194
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:29,518
(Applause)
