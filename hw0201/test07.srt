1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:07,437
There's not a lot in this world
that we can be truly certain about.

2
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:09,597
But I'm willing to guarantee

3
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:11,957
that most of us in this room

4
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,337
have seen this little blue dog before.

5
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,677
(Laughter)

6
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:18,237
This little dog is, of course,

7
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:22,797
the star of the global smash hit
children's show "Bluey,"

8
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:26,797
created and founded
right here in Brisbane.

9
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:28,817
The show also takes place here,

10
00:00:28,818 --> 00:00:31,437
with the iconic skyline and sights

11
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:36,737
visible as we follow
the adventures of the Heeler family.

12
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,977
Bluey, a primary school-aged
blue heeler dog,

13
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:41,497
her little sister Bingo,

14
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:44,677
their dad Bandit and their mum Chilli.

15
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:49,657
Each bite-sized, seven-minute
episode offers a slice of life,

16
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:52,317
delving into valuable life lessons

17
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,877
and the nuances of parenting

18
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,877
through a playful lens
of childhood imagination.

19
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:02,837
Since the show's debut in 2018,

20
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:06,377
"Bluey" has taken the world by storm.

21
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:08,857
The international success in particular

22
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:13,017
is unlike any Australian
media of its kind.

23
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,257
In fact, "Bluey" is so popular

24
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:19,017
that there are countless videos
of kids in other countries

25
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:21,877
pronouncing things like "no,"

26
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:23,317
(Laughter)

27
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:29,697
and "mum" in little Australian accents.

28
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:35,037
But what if I told you that the show
isn't just a hit with kids?

29
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,937
Evidently, I am not a child.

30
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:39,617
(Laughter)

31
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:42,397
Nor do I have any kids yet.

32
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:44,797
But let me tell you,

33
00:01:44,798 --> 00:01:48,177
I have spent hours laughing,

34
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:51,397
crying, questioning life,

35
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:57,117
just being captivated by cartoon dogs.

36
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,537
(Laughter)

37
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:00,337
And it isn't just me.

38
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:01,797
You might be surprised to see

39
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:04,157
that this "Adult Bluey Fans"
Facebook group

40
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:08,117
has more than 600,000 members.

41
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,477
(Laughter)

42
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:14,797
Then there’s the “Bluey” subreddit
with over 200,000.

43
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:21,857
And Bluey is also Insta-famous
with 1.3 million followers.

44
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:23,537
It's no secret,

45
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:27,557
older audiences love "Bluey."

46
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:29,517
Which really got me thinking.

47
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:33,837
I mean, there has to be
something more going on here

48
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:38,537
because, well, no offense
to the average three-year-old,

49
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:42,457
but you wouldn't find me
watching something like "Peppa Pig"

50
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,937
or "Cocomelon" in my free time.

51
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:52,757
So what is it about "Bluey"
that draws in older audiences?

52
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,557
The show's creator, Joe Brumm,

53
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:57,937
has spoken openly about his goal
of creating something

54
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:01,717
that parents and carers
can genuinely enjoy

55
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:04,157
rather than just tolerate.

56
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:06,257
And there are definitely parts of the show

57
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:09,257
that feel like they were put in
for the adults watching,

58
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:10,837
which isn't a new thing.

59
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:13,697
I mean, we've all seen
something like "Shrek"

60
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:16,837
and been kind of astonished
by some of the things

61
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:20,037
that they slipped in there.

62
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:25,017
But what I love about "Bluey's"
adult subtext, we'll call it,

63
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:29,477
is that its objective
isn’t always being crude or cheeky

64
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:32,657
but being relatable.

65
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:36,537
And one of the most
relatable moments of "Bluey"

66
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:43,057
are the scenes where we see
the back seat of the family car.

67
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:47,637
I can see so much
of my own childhood in this image,

68
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:49,417
and I bet a lot of you watching

69
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:53,617
have had a car that looks
a lot like that one.

70
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:55,457
Like most children's shows,

71
00:03:55,458 --> 00:04:00,317
"Bluey" episodes appear to be centered
around some kind of life lesson.

72
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,797
There's the classic,
listen to your parents,

73
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,017
eat your veggies,

74
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:06,937
get back on the bike when you fall down.

75
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:13,717
But then there are lessons like,
work-life balance is important.

76
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:15,677
Raising kids isn't easy,

77
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:18,817
sometimes you'll make mistakes.

78
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:21,257
Aging can be daunting,

79
00:04:21,258 --> 00:04:26,517
and your health means everything.

80
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:32,037
Not quite what you'd expect
from a kids' show, is it?

81
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,317
There's no shortage
of moral teachings for kids

82
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,277
and for adults.

83
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,057
In particular, the show portrays adulthood

84
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:46,277
in a way that's realistic and nuanced.

85
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:50,857
We see the adult characters
making mistakes, getting emotional,

86
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:55,037
learning all kinds
of lessons of their own.

87
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:01,077
You can imagine how reassuring
that would feel for a first-time parent

88
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:05,497
or a teenager heading into adulthood.

89
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:08,477
In the episode "Baby Race"
Chilli, the mom,

90
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,337
speaks openly about her experience
with overthinking parenting

91
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:17,737
and comparing herself
to the other moms around her.

92
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:22,937
She says she’ll never forget
receiving a visit from her friend Bella,

93
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:28,017
a mother of nine
who's learnt a thing or two.

94
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:30,377
Bella listens to Chilli's troubles

95
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:34,197
and tells her, “There’s something
you need to know:

96
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:37,377
You're doing great."

97
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,637
These words are spoken
to Chilli on screen,

98
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:45,037
but they aren't meant only for her ears.

99
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,757
And it's interactions like these
that set "Bluey" apart

100
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:51,537
from the average kids' media.

101
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:55,357
The show openly engages
with its older viewers,

102
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:58,157
not only acknowledging their presence

103
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:03,417
but often communicating directly to them.

104
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,017
The level of dimension and authenticity

105
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:09,897
in "Bluey's" stories and characters

106
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:11,817
is exceptional.

107
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:13,437
The writers haven't shied away

108
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:17,117
from portraying disabilities
and neurodivergence

109
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:20,897
and have even touched
on things like anxiety, divorce,

110
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:24,157
infertility, bullying

111
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:26,857
and death.

112
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,037
The show's received a lot of praise

113
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,937
for its portrayal of these
more substantial themes,

114
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:39,677
in a way that is still digestible
and meaningful for its younger audience.

115
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:42,797
It can prompt adults
to have conversations with kids

116
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:46,317
about things that they might
not have come across before.

117
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:50,197
It could also help a child
understand their own experience

118
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:54,537
if they're going
through something similar.

119
00:06:54,538 --> 00:07:00,257
There's an authenticity in the way
that "Bluey" incorporates very important,

120
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,777
real aspects of life,

121
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:06,917
with an appropriate balance
of fun and lightheartedness

122
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:10,217
that you'd expect from a cartoon.

123
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:19,237
This authenticity has resonated
with younger and older viewers alike.

124
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:24,437
The show captures a quintessential
childhood experience,

125
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:29,357
evoking a rich sense of nostalgia
in its older viewers,

126
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,197
especially for Australians,

127
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:35,637
seeing the crows and bin chickens
hanging around the rubbish.

128
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:38,237
Or watching Bluey and Bingo
get a sausage and bread

129
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:40,997
at their local hardware store.

130
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:43,157
Look familiar?

131
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:47,157
But you don't need to be Australian
to appreciate "Bluey."

132
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:53,057
There's such a true-to-life
portrayal of imagination and play

133
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:56,397
with themes of school
and friends and growing up,

134
00:07:56,398 --> 00:08:01,037
which makes the show so nostalgic.

135
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,497
There are so many games and rhymes

136
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:09,757
and dance moves that nobody
even remembers learning.

137
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:13,497
Every kid just seems to know.

138
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:21,677
And "Bluey" incorporates these stunningly.

139
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:28,197
The human brain is hard-wired
to crave that nostalgia.

140
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:32,277
It makes us feel good, warm inside.

141
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,237
From a psychology standpoint,

142
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:37,657
adults often turn to things like nostalgia

143
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:42,957
and childlike activities
as a form of escapism,

144
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,737
transporting our minds
back to a simpler time

145
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:51,757
to step away from the pressures
of daily life for a little while.

146
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:54,337
And there's good reason for this.

147
00:08:54,338 --> 00:09:00,417
As we grow up, life tends
to become a lot less whimsical.

148
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,977
There's very little room
in our adult world

149
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,937
for make-believe and pretend,

150
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:10,177
and the way that we use our imaginations
becomes a lot more practical

151
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:13,617
and a lot less playful.

152
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:16,757
For me, I'm not sure exactly when,

153
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:20,277
but one day I stopped
believing in the fairies

154
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,257
that were living in the garden.

155
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,677
And now if I fall asleep in the car,

156
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:29,497
I don't wake up magically in my bed.

157
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:32,957
I just wake up with a weird neck.

158
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,457
So the ability to escape for a moment,

159
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:41,617
to re-experience some
of that long-lost childhood magic

160
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:44,357
through the lens of "Bluey"

161
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:46,717
has provided a lot of comfort

162
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:52,437
and wholesomeness that's really
touched people's hearts.

163
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:56,357
Some adult fans who lived
through difficult childhoods

164
00:09:56,358 --> 00:10:01,777
have described watching "Bluey"
as therapeutic and healing.

165
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:07,617
They find that it offers them a chance
to vicariously experience the safe,

166
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:10,117
warm and positive environment

167
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:13,637
that the characters are growing up in.

168
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:17,917
It's also worth noting that "Bluey's"
skyrocket into stardom

169
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:22,777
sort of coincided
with the COVID-19 pandemic.

170
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:27,017
As the demand for at-home
entertainment for children surged,

171
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:32,157
a lot of grown ups also found themselves
turning to things like cartoons

172
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:33,977
and nostalgic media

173
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:38,177
as a way of getting
through the worst of the pandemic.

174
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:43,777
People can be particularly drawn
to escapism during tough times.

175
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:45,817
And in the last few years,

176
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:50,217
a beautiful cartoon about a family of dogs

177
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:56,637
has become a beacon of solace
for many of us.

178
00:10:56,638 --> 00:11:00,777
So relatability, authenticity,

179
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,117
nostalgia and comfort.

180
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:08,097
There is one more key element

181
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:12,977
that draws adult viewers
into the world of "Bluey,"

182
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:15,697
and that is ...

183
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:24,057
The show's profound ability
to introduce new perspectives.

184
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,697
For a lot of us grown-ups,

185
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:32,097
we have a responsibility to teach
and nurture the little ones in our lives.

186
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:33,437
But equally,

187
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:39,757
there is so much
that we can learn from them.

188
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:46,857
Children approach the world
with an innate sense of wonder.

189
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:49,877
They always seem to find enjoyment

190
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:53,297
and novelty in the mundane.

191
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:57,737
And if it isn’t there,
they will create it.

192
00:11:57,738 --> 00:12:01,737
To Bluey and Bingo, that isn't
just a swing, it's a cocoon.

193
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:04,077
"Let's play butterflies."

194
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,017
That piece of cardboard
looks like a volcano.

195
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,937
"I know, let's pretend we're dinosaurs."

196
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:15,177
Anything can be a game.

197
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:22,057
Anything can be new and exciting and fun.

198
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:26,117
A lot of us adults, with our serious lives

199
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:30,537
and our developed frontal lobes,

200
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:34,677
could do with a reminder of that.

201
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:40,097
Kids teach us to do a silly walk
to spice up the housework,

202
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:45,597
throw a sticky gecko toy at the ceiling
and wait for it to fall down.

203
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,037
Make friends with a stranger,

204
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:50,297
dance in public,

205
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:53,797
save a caterpillar's life.

206
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:57,057
They teach us to approach the world

207
00:12:57,058 --> 00:13:02,777
with curiosity and hope and playfulness.

208
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:06,437
And above all,

209
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:13,537
they teach us not to take
ourselves too seriously.

210
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:18,637
(Laughter)

211
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:22,877
"Bluey" has grown a devout audience

212
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,637
of children,

213
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,117
teenagers

214
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,417
and adults.

215
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:34,497
And that's thanks to its
relatability and authenticity,

216
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:36,497
as well as the comfort

217
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:40,597
and perspective that it has to offer.

218
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:44,337
With its dimensional
stories and characters

219
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:49,497
against a backdrop
of vibrant Australian imagery,

220
00:13:49,498 --> 00:13:56,237
"Bluey" really is more
than just another cartoon for kids.

221
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:59,817
So next time you find yourself
interacting with a child

222
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:03,337
or watching one
of their TV shows or movies,

223
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:09,877
remember that there may be something
much deeper at play.

224
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:13,177
And keep an eye out for all the weird

225
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:14,857
and wonderful things

226
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:20,777
that you can learn from little humans

227
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,697
and little blue dogs.

228
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:23,877
Thank you.

229
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:28,878
(Applause)
