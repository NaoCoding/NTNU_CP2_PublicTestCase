1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,498
How do you feel about going to work?

2
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:07,252
Excited to start the day
or kind of dreading it?

3
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:11,757
We've been hard-wired to believe
that work isn't supposed to be enjoyable.

4
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:13,091
Work is work.

5
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:14,718
But here's the thing.

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,886
In the future,

7
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:18,430
companies will succeed or fail

8
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:22,642
based on how much
their people enjoy their work.

9
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:24,686
Now, when I tell that to business leaders,

10
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:27,522
a lot of them say, "That's great, Rosie,

11
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:31,485
but it's the end of fiscal quarter
and the CEO is breathing down my neck

12
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:33,612
because the board
is breathing down her neck

13
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:35,906
because our stock price is dropping.

14
00:00:35,907 --> 00:00:39,034
Let's talk about enjoying work
once we're in a better spot.

15
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:40,202
Or never."

16
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:41,536
Now I get it.

17
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:45,290
These leaders are right
to fixate on business performance.

18
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,585
But I've spent the past six years
exploring this topic

19
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,838
as a people and organization
expert at BCG,

20
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,590
and the data is clear.

21
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:57,260
Making work more enjoyable
pays off big time.

22
00:00:57,261 --> 00:01:01,431
Just look at the top 100 companies
to work for in America.

23
00:01:01,432 --> 00:01:03,475
Over the last 28 years,

24
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:06,895
their stock returns
were more than double their peers'.

25
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:10,857
So instead of asking
how can we boost productivity,

26
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:14,945
these leaders should be asking,
how can we boost enjoyment?

27
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:18,031
Productivity and profit will follow.

28
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:23,036
So here are my top three tips
to make work more enjoyable.

29
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:26,665
Tip one: double down on joy.

30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,877
Ask yourself, "What do I enjoy
most about my work?

31
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,338
And how can I do more of that?"

32
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:34,673
Take Trader Joe's,

33
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:37,843
an American grocery store
with a cult following.

34
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:39,511
If you've been to a Trader Joe's,

35
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:42,389
you know it just feels
different shopping there.

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,475
Every employee seems genuinely
happy to see you.

37
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,894
They want to know
what you're doing this weekend

38
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,897
and whether you've tried
these pumpkin spice Joe-Joe's.

39
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:55,485
It's almost surprising how happy they seem
in a stereotypically low-paying,

40
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:57,445
high-turnover retail job.

41
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:59,781
So how does Trader Joe's do it?

42
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:02,951
Well, they know that the fun part
of working in retail

43
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:05,579
is chatting up your co-workers
and the customers.

44
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,790
So they've created
this super social environment

45
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,960
by purposefully overstaffing their stores.

46
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,170
The result?

47
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:16,506
Overstaffing means employees
enjoy their work more,

48
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:18,633
are less likely to feel burnt out,

49
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:21,094
and are less likely to consider quitting.

50
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:24,097
In fact, one in 10 Trader Joe's employees

51
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:26,641
has worked there for over a decade,

52
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:30,228
which is pretty crazy
when you consider how expensive it is

53
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:32,230
to replace an employee,

54
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:36,276
not to mention the lost productivity
as they learn how to do the job.

55
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:39,905
But overstaffing doesn't
just save Trader Joe's money,

56
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:42,532
it makes them more money, too.

57
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:46,745
Employees have more time to interact
with customers and drive spending.

58
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:49,206
If you compare Trader Joe's to its peers,

59
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:53,043
they make 50 percent
higher revenue per employee.

60
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:56,588
So doubling down on joy
is good for employees,

61
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:59,549
customers and shareholders alike.

62
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,678
And it didn't require expensive
pay rises or fancy bonuses.

63
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:07,974
Yes, you need to pay
your employees a living wage,

64
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:13,271
but don't make the mistake of thinking
more enjoyment only means more money.

65
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:14,481
It doesn't.

66
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:16,983
We all know people
who make a ton of money

67
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,777
and still loathe their jobs.

68
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,779
So get creative.

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,574
Figure out what it is that you
enjoy most about your work

70
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:26,743
and do more of that.

71
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:30,622
Tip two: eliminate frustrations.

72
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:33,250
My second tip is the opposite.

73
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,170
Ask "What's most frustrating
about the work I do

74
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,673
and how can I do less of that?"

75
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,049
Back in 2020,

76
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,387
US department store Neiman Marcus
was in pretty dire straits.

77
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:47,764
Employees were quitting at record rates,

78
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,809
the pandemic had closed
nearly all their stores

79
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,478
and by May they were filing
for bankruptcy.

80
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,148
To survive, they needed to make
some serious changes.

81
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:59,401
So they created an option

82
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:02,696
for store associates
to serve customers remotely

83
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:05,865
as work-from-home digital stylists.

84
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:08,910
But here's where things get
really interesting.

85
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:11,579
When the world reopened post-pandemic,

86
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,334
Neiman Marcus could have easily gone back
to their old ways of working.

87
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,670
But they know from extensive surveys

88
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:22,507
that flexibility is their employees'
number one concern.

89
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:26,428
So while other companies
were issuing return-to-work mandates,

90
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:29,973
Neiman Marcus doubled down
on flexible work.

91
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:34,978
Now, a store associate might spend
some three days a week in-person

92
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,855
behind the makeup counter

93
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,734
and two days working from home,
serving online shoppers.

94
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:44,612
With more people shopping online,
it's a win for customers,

95
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:47,073
employees and the company.

96
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:50,160
Staff turnover has dropped by 20 percent.

97
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:53,204
So if you want people
to perform at their best,

98
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,206
ask what's getting in their way

99
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:59,753
and then design the work
to minimize those frustrations.

100
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:03,214
Tip three: keep experimenting.

101
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:07,427
My final tip is to revisit
enjoyment repeatedly.

102
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:11,056
What works well today,
might not work a month down the line.

103
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,850
In my job, our teams take a weekly survey

104
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:16,269
about whether we're enjoying our work.

105
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,438
And then we review the results together.

106
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,442
But we don't spend it poring over
pie charts and line graphs.

107
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:25,695
We make it fun by asking questions like,

108
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:29,949
"Which one of these nine kangaroos
represents how this week went for you?"

109
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,493
And someone might say,

110
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:35,038
â€œWell, I started out this week
as the snuggly joey,

111
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,166
safe and sound in his mother's pouch.

112
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:41,378
But then I had a really
atrocious client meeting

113
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,296
and felt kind of hung out to dry.

114
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:45,131
So by the end of the week,

115
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:49,511
I was like the more feral,
possibly rabid kangaroo."

116
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:53,515
It might sound like a silly process
for such a serious task,

117
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:54,974
but it works.

118
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:58,686
We've come up with so many ways
to make work more enjoyable,

119
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:02,148
like shifting a morning check-in
30 minutes later

120
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:05,819
so that a team member can drop
his kid off at kindergarten.

121
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,570
A trivial change for us

122
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:10,073
that made the world of difference to him.

123
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:13,410
So make a habit of talking
about enjoying work,

124
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:15,912
and you'll come up
with surprising solutions

125
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:18,873
that make work
more enjoyable for everyone.

126
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:22,460
So before you get back to whatever
it was that you were doing

127
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,712
before you tuned into this talk,

128
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:26,548
I'd love for you to ask,

129
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,633
how can I enjoy this more?

130
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:30,885
Because what's enjoyable for you

131
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:33,805
is good for your company too.

132
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:38,806
Thank you.
