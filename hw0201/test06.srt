1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,873
I am so excited to be here
to talk about gaming.

2
00:00:02,874 --> 00:00:05,792
There has been so many
changes in this industry

3
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:10,172
since I first started at Electronic Arts
almost 30 years ago.

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:13,175
I was very young, by the way, back then.

5
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:16,219
Now if you look
at these comparisons here,

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,807
our characters looked
more like 8-bit Laura, OK?

7
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:24,269
Today, they look more like 8K Laura.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,355
And I must say, I kind of wish
I looked more like 8K Laura.

9
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:30,484
But that's not the point
I'm trying to make here right now.

10
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:31,651
The point really is,

11
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:36,907
is that graphic fidelity is one
of the most visible revolutions in games,

12
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:39,451
but there have been so many others.

13
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:42,204
Games have become social connection hubs,

14
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:45,665
and games are now synonymous
with pop culture.

15
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,001
I mean, take "Star Wars" as an example.

16
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,587
They have completely evolved
their narrative universe

17
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:53,131
based on over 10 games.

18
00:00:53,132 --> 00:00:55,133
TV adaptations like "The Last of Us"

19
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:57,928
are winning Emmys for HBO.

20
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,888
And our own awards show,

21
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,640
The Game Awards,

22
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:05,310
had over 120 million viewers last year.

23
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,395
Now for some context,

24
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:09,022
if you take the Grammys,

25
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:13,443
the Oscars and the Emmys, times three,

26
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:16,530
it doesn't add up to how many viewers
we have in the Game Awards.

27
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,739
That's incredible.

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,782
(Applause)

29
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:21,159
Thank you, yes, good for gaming.

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,495
And this is good news for gaming.

31
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:27,457
But I'm here to tell you, I think
it's even better news for humanity.

32
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:30,877
In a world where
there's artificial intelligence,

33
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,171
artificial interactions,

34
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:36,967
having human connection is going to be
more important than ever.

35
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:44,307
And gaming is the perfect
medium to connect us.

36
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:48,270
AI and games have been synonymous
with each other from the beginning.

37
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:50,480
Remember those little ghosts in "Pac-Man?"

38
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:53,400
Little pixelated opponents in "Madden?"

39
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:57,195
Those may not seem very intelligent today,
but that was our start.

40
00:01:57,196 --> 00:02:00,657
And today, AI, particularly generative AI,

41
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:04,911
is going to be an exponential
accelerator for making games,

42
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:06,830
for how players interact with games

43
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:11,459
and how they personalize
and create their own experiences.

44
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,547
But AI is not the only thing
driving change in the gaming industry

45
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,841
and in society in general.

46
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:22,095
Social media has transformed our lives.

47
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:23,763
I mean, think about it.

48
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:28,560
Hundreds of millions
of interactions and transactions daily.

49
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:32,147
Millions of followers, social platforms.

50
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:36,610
You would think we are more
connected than we've ever been,

51
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:38,737
but that's not the case.

52
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:40,864
I mean, left to our own devices,

53
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:44,618
well, we have been left
to our own devices.

54
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:49,080
And there's emerging evidence to say
that there's a trend happening

55
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:53,627
that the surgeon general is calling
an “epidemic of loneliness.”

56
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:55,921
The data says that people
are having a hard time

57
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:58,381
making and keeping friends,
more than ever.

58
00:02:58,382 --> 00:03:01,509
I mean, this is scary stuff.

59
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,970
We all know that belonging to a community

60
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:06,097
and having a sense
of belonging to each other

61
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:09,935
is critical to our mental well-being.

62
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,311
But don't worry,

63
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:16,107
I'm here to tell you
that games are going to save us.

64
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:17,901
Games bring people together.

65
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,819
That's what I love about them.

66
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,780
They're creative, they're fun.

67
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:25,158
I mean, take a look at this video here
of this incredibly fun gameplay.

68
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,119
People are creating together, sharing,

69
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,747
expressing themselves, collaborating.

70
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:32,999
This is what gaming can do.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,835
Games have always been my choice of media.

72
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:40,006
Now I love a great movie and reality TV
as much as the next person,

73
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:42,550
but nothing lights up your brain

74
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,096
like a great game
and interactive entertainment.

75
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:48,223
I mean, even the 
World Health Organization,

76
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:50,141
after years of skepticism about gaming,

77
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:53,228
has come out to espouse
the benefits of gaming.

78
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,022
This was a massive turning point
in public perception.

79
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:59,985
It also spawned a lot of research
around the benefits of gaming,

80
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:04,114
including the power of play in 2023,

81
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:06,700
where they surveyed 13,000 respondents

82
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,702
in 12 countries

83
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:11,454
to validate what many of us know,

84
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,581
that gaming helps with critical skills,

85
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:16,918
critical thinking,
judgment, collaboration.

86
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,129
But what I found most interesting

87
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,339
was that 55 percent of the respondents

88
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:27,679
said they play games
to not feel alone or isolated.

89
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,806
And I get it.

90
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,267
I play games to not feel alone.

91
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,686
And some of the happiest
moments of my life

92
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,522
I was in isolation.

93
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,149
About 20 years ago,

94
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,027
my husband and I welcomed twins.

95
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,029
Oh, thank you, I know, they were so cute.

96
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,280
That was 20 years ago.

97
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,906
(Laughter)

98
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,575
They don't look like that anymore.

99
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,410
But we were so excited

100
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,996
and so happy about this.

101
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:56,624
But we were homebound
for the first time in our lives.

102
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,420
We quickly realized that the best way
for social connection

103
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,963
with our friends and family

104
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:05,425
and, dare I say, even each other,
was through gaming.

105
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:07,052
We quickly joined a family guild,

106
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,678
and we played "World of Warcraft"

107
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:12,015
for the first several years
of our kids' lives.

108
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:15,435
Now I love most games,
and I do, I love to play games.

109
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:18,980
But nothing beats playing together.

110
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:22,942
And people who play games
together play for longer.

111
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:25,320
Studies also show
that people who play games

112
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:28,114
and collaborate in games
are actually more collaborative

113
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:31,076
and more cooperative outside of games.

114
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,953
That's pretty remarkable.

115
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,498
Now when I first started in the industry,

116
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:39,417
I started a company called
Westwood Studios.

117
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:42,712
And I was responsible
for our online community.

118
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,881
And we had -- this is back in 1996.

119
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:47,050
We had -- wait for it --

120
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:50,720
one million players in our community,
which was huge back then.

121
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:51,888
It was huge.

122
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,598
I thought we were really hot stuff.

123
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,058
Fast forward to today,

124
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:59,396
we have 700 million players
in the network at EA.

125
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:02,065
That's more than double
the population of the US.

126
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,358
Incredible number.

127
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:06,486
But the magic number
isn't actually 700 million.

128
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,864
The magic comes when you play
with three to five other people.

129
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:13,993
And we call this your atomic network.

130
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:17,330
And it's no accident that the atomic
number is actually three to five.

131
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:20,625
There's a really interesting study
that Colorado State University did

132
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:23,002
with 6,000 respondents about loneliness.

133
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:25,672
And what we know
is that people, on average,

134
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,215
for history, and now, today,

135
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:30,093
people on average have
about four to five friends always.

136
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:33,096
But today, the difference is
people feel far less connected

137
00:06:33,097 --> 00:06:34,347
than they ever have,

138
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:39,561
and they're longing for connection
and to do things together.

139
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:42,188
Now another dimension
of gaming that I love

140
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,358
is that you can get
to know each other playing games.

141
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:49,279
Your personality and your skills
are on full display when you play a game.

142
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,906
Now let’s face it,
most of us are not going to make it

143
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,533
as a Navy SEAL in the real world,

144
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:55,326
but that’s why games are so much fun.

145
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:56,744
You can roleplay this, right?

146
00:06:56,745 --> 00:07:00,415
So imagine, if you will, your squad
is dropped into a remote location,

147
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,833
you're fighting for survival,

148
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:04,335
you're strategizing on the fly,

149
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,796
all while the clock ticks away.

150
00:07:06,797 --> 00:07:10,675
Another good use of gaming
could be compatibility test.

151
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,635
Now would I have married my husband

152
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:15,930
if he wasn't such an upstanding
guild member of "World of Warcraft"?

153
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:17,557
(Laughter)

154
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:18,766
We'll never know.

155
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,810
And he doesn't know I included that photo.

156
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:22,061
So, sorry, honey, hello.

157
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:23,313
(Laughter)

158
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:25,273
Now you may be in an atomic network now,

159
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:27,108
or you may be looking for one.

160
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:31,070
There are billions of gamers
out there playing games.

161
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,324
You can join "Fortnite,"
"Minecraft," "The Sims," "FC."

162
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:36,826
The list is long.

163
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:38,912
And sure, you might get
chirped in the chat,

164
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:42,081
but you also might meet
the love of your life.

165
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:45,043
So many people are ready to play.

166
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:47,712
They're ready to enter
epic worlds, epic adventures,

167
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:50,590
meet amazing people.

168
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:52,133
I really believe

169
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:55,762
that games are the superior
social platform of the future.

170
00:07:55,763 --> 00:08:00,141
They’re immersive, active, engaging
and overwhelmingly fun.

171
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:05,813
So yes, social media,
technology, particularly AI,

172
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:08,816
are going to drastically change our future

173
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:12,904
and particularly the relationships
that we have with each other.

174
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,322
So being intentional

175
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,533
and maintaining human connection

176
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:18,117
through games

177
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,662
is an amazing path through.

178
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:23,748
So this is a call to arms.

179
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,458
Stop scrolling,

180
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,293
pick up your game controller,

181
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:29,587
jump into an epic world,

182
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:31,130
live an amazing story

183
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,674
and go on an exciting adventure

184
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:35,218
with three to five
of your closest friends.

185
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,388
It could just unite us all.

186
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,556
Thank you.

187
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:43,560
(Applause)

188
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,896
Manoush Zomorodi:
I have a question, come over here.

189
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:48,648
Talk to me about the hardware.

190
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,942
Where do you see that progressing?

191
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,403
I mean, we see people
putting things on their heads.

192
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,989
Are they going to be put,
I don't know, chips, brains.

193
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,657
Talk us through what you see.

194
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,243
Laura Miele: Chips and brains,
toasters, refrigerators,

195
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:01,411
you can game everywhere.

196
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:05,290
There's already a broad spectrum
of accessibility to game

197
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,958
and interactive experiences today,

198
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,087
and that's only going to expand
significantly as time goes on.

199
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:14,716
And what I love about gaming
is how vast that spectrum actually is.

200
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:18,428
And I think the future will still --
you can still pick up your mobile device,

201
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,805
play word puzzles with friends

202
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:25,143
to, fast forward, put on,
to your point, goggles, glasses,

203
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,687
and you know, you saw
the Navy SEAL footage

204
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:29,397
from the game called "Battlefield."

205
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:32,942
You will feel like you are actually
in that landscape and in those worlds,

206
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:35,153
it will be super immersive
and super connected,

207
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:37,780
which I think is only going
to continue to help us feel

208
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:39,616
like we can connect on a human level.

209
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,826
So I'm really excited
and optimistic about it.

210
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,369
MZ: OK, looking forward to that.

211
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,621
Laura, thank you so much.

212
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:46,205
LM: Thanks, Manoush.

213
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:51,206
(Applause)
