1
00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:05,542
We live in an incredible
time of exploration,

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:12,841
on the verge of finding out
whether we are alone in the cosmos or not.

3
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:18,305
This is one of the biggest questions
humankind has ever asked.

4
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:21,892
And now, for the first time,

5
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:25,645
we have a tool that could find out.

6
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:31,818
Because the James Webb Space Telescope
is a telescope large enough

7
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:37,115
to be able to catch light
from planets like ours,

8
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:44,164
as small as ours, but circling
other stars light-years away.

9
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:50,545
Because this search is a search
over vast cosmic distances,

10
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:53,799
even light needs years

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,678
to travel these trillions
of miles between stars.

12
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:05,310
So when you look up at the sky at night,
you look back in time.

13
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:09,773
Let's imagine you were on a planet
circling our neighboring star,

14
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:12,442
about four light-years away.

15
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:18,657
Then you would see the Earth
tonight, like it was four years ago.

16
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:22,452
On a planet 70 million light-years away,

17
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:25,956
you could still see
the dinosaurs roam here.

18
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:30,502
And it also means that out in the sky,

19
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:35,715
there is a star
whose light arrives tonight,

20
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:39,427
that was sent out when you were born.

21
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:44,224
Your personal connection to the cosmos.

22
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:46,560
So these distances are vast,

23
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:50,397
but astronomers, throughout time,

24
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:56,153
have managed to unravel
and reveal mysteries of the cosmos,

25
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:59,573
because light and matter interact.

26
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:01,408
So light carries energy,

27
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,745
and if it hits a molecule
with just the right energy,

28
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:10,167
that molecule will start
to swing and rotate.

29
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:12,627
So it's really the missing light,

30
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:15,672
the light that doesn't make
it to my telescope,

31
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:22,846
that tells me which molecules
the light encountered before it got to me.

32
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,265
It's a little bit like a passport stamp

33
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:30,478
that tells you where a traveler was
before arriving here.

34
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:37,402
So when you look at this incredible
image of the Pillars of Creation

35
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:41,781
taken by the James Webb Space Telescope,

36
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:43,617
it is gorgeous.

37
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:46,494
But if you analyze the light,

38
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:51,124
you realize that we are watching
a stellar nursery,

39
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,086
where we see stars emerge and ignite.

40
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:59,674
And when you look at stars
in our night sky,

41
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:04,095
you reveal another astonishing truth --

42
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:11,144
that you and me, all of us,
are made of ancient stardust.

43
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,981
Because it took the heat
in the core of a star

44
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:19,027
and the violent explosion
at the end of its lifetime

45
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:24,074
to make the atoms that made you and me.

46
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:26,826
So on a fundamental level,

47
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:32,374
we are connected to each other
and to the cosmos around us.

48
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,460
And now, for the first time,

49
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:40,632
we get to search
for other organisms somewhere else

50
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:44,803
that might be made
of ancient stardust, too.

51
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:50,976
But when you try
to find life in the universe,

52
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,561
it is incredibly hard,

53
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:56,356
because planets are so much smaller,

54
00:03:56,357 --> 00:04:00,443
and they are close
to their bright and big stars.

55
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:04,322
And we don’t only want
to find planets like ours,

56
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:09,452
we want to look in their air
and on their surface for signs of life.

57
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:13,581
So what we do is we wait

58
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:18,753
until the planet crosses
our line of sight to its star,

59
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:21,506
and the light from its star hits,

60
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:27,929
smashes into the atmosphere of the planet
before it gets to my telescope.

61
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,641
So I can look for these passport stamps

62
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:36,563
to figure out what's in the air
of planets very far away,

63
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:40,066
and the light fingerprint.

64
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:43,820
The best light fingerprint
we have for life on the Earth

65
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:49,951
is the combination of oxygen and methane
for carbon-based life,

66
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:51,828
with a water solvent,

67
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:57,667
on a planet in the temperate zone
around its star.

68
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:00,211
But I was really curious:

69
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:08,053
How long could this light fingerprint
tell you that there’s life on our planet?

70
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:13,850
And so I figured out that,
for about two billion years,

71
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:19,481
the biosphere has painted signs
of life into our atmosphere.

72
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:22,108
So for half of Earth's existence,

73
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:27,030
you could tell that there is
life on our planet.

74
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:30,408
And if life does this somewhere else too,

75
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:36,790
for the first time,
we have now a chance to spot it.

76
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:41,294
And so searching for life in the universe

77
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:45,882
actually made me see our planet
completely differently.

78
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:48,176
Here, for example, you see biota

79
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:52,389
that colors these amazing
hot sulphur springs in New Zealand

80
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,016
this gorgeous orange color,

81
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:57,227
and it lets you start to think

82
00:05:57,228 --> 00:06:00,563
about how different
these other planets could be.

83
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:04,692
There could be could be planets
completely covered in oceans,

84
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:07,695
with waves that never break on a shore.

85
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:14,619
Or planets half in eternal sunlight
and half in perpetual night.

86
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,124
Or planets that are covered
with a purple landscape.

87
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:26,381
Because purple bacteria is very sturdy,
it can thrive under red sunlight.

88
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:34,055
So eight out of ten stars out there
are actually small red stars.

89
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:38,351
So purple might be the new green,

90
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:42,480
when searching for life in the cosmos.

91
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:48,153
But we know that one
out of five sun-like stars

92
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:52,449
has a planet that could
potentially be like ours.

93
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:59,330
So with 200 billion stars
in our Milky Way alone,

94
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:06,087
that means we have billions
and billions of possibilities.

95
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:09,174
I founded the Carl Sagan
Institute at Cornell

96
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:15,180
to bring thinkers and creative minds
from many different fields and backgrounds

97
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,599
and ways of life together

98
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,353
to create the toolkit
to find life in the cosmos.

99
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:25,982
And so we created a spectral database,

100
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:30,778
a light-fingerprint database
for habitable worlds.

101
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:36,367
And in case you're wondering,
actually, Jurassic worlds,

102
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:41,998
where space dinosaurs
might roam somewhere else,

103
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:45,627
are actually easier to find
than a modern Earth,

104
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:50,215
because there was more oxygen
when the dinosaurs lived here.

105
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:52,425
I'm not saying there are space dinosaurs,

106
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:56,971
but I'm just saying if you ever wanted
there to be, I'm giving you options.

107
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:58,973
(Laughter)

108
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:00,850
But when you search,

109
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:06,439
then one of the questions that came
was also if there's life in the cosmos.

110
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,024
Of course, I don't know that yet.

111
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:10,026
But if there's life in the cosmos,

112
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:14,739
could somebody be looking at us
with just the same technology we have?

113
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,533
And there's a space in the sky,

114
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:19,911
a strip where you have
just the right vantage point

115
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:22,539
to see the Earth go in front of the Sun.

116
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,794
And it encapsulates about 1,000 stars
within 300 light-years,

117
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:30,630
what's really our cosmic background.

118
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:37,428
And so the question is,
where could we be the aliens?

119
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,307
Is there life in the cosmos?
I don't know.

120
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:45,019
We don't know yet,
but I really want to find out,

121
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,732
because the cosmos
is 13.8 billion years old,

122
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:53,945
but we all get to live
in the most exciting time,

123
00:08:53,946 --> 00:09:00,868
where the search for life on other planets
went from impossible to possible.

124
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:03,621
And it's at the edge
of technical capability,

125
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:07,375
but we're already designing
larger telescopes

126
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:09,836
that could catch more light
of these planets

127
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:12,589
to find out if there’s life out there

128
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,216
calling another planet home.

129
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,884
From a tiny town in Austria,

130
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:19,095
when I looked up at the stars

131
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:22,599
and wondered if they could
be suns to their planets,

132
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,352
to now sitting in Carl Sagan's
old office at Cornell,

133
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:30,440
the journey has been
challenging, inspiring

134
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:32,233
and full of wonder,

135
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:34,944
because those thousands of new stars,

136
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:36,904
new suns [in] the sky,

137
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:39,616
hold a breathtaking promise

138
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:45,246
that our adventure of exploration
has just begun.

139
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:50,793
So go out at night
and find your favorite star,

140
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:58,384
and allow yourself to wonder,
what if we're not alone?

141
00:09:58,385 --> 00:09:59,552
Thank you.

142
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:04,553
(Cheers and applause)
