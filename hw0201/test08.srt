1
00:00:00,476 --> 00:00:02,795
(Spanish) Este es una 
historia de esperanza.

2
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:05,275
(English) This is a story about hope.

3
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:07,355
I grew up in Mexico City,

4
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:08,795
and as a little kid,

5
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:11,435
I had no clue about global
climate change,

6
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:15,275
the problem I'm working on
in Europe today.

7
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,715
But I did know air pollution.

8
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:20,235
The smog was so thick back then

9
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:23,355
that you could literally see
the air you were breathing.

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:28,315
Today, Mexico City's air
is dramatically cleaner.

11
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:29,635
What changed?

12
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:33,515
A combination of policy and data.

13
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:37,435
Mexico City started inspecting
vehicles every six months,

14
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:39,035
using cleaner fuels

15
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:41,875
and improving energy efficiency.

16
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:47,515
Mexico City's air pollution problem
dropped from number one in the world

17
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:50,555
to 999.

18
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:55,555
I realized firsthand how this combination
of smart policy and data

19
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,755
significantly improved the air in my city.

20
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,315
And it was clear to me:

21
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:05,715
I wanted to make a career
out of finding solutions to pollution.

22
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:08,195
I studied chemical engineering in Mexico

23
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:11,795
and went to Austin, Texas for my PhD.

24
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:13,155
And that's where I found out

25
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,795
about the huge climate problem
caused by methane,

26
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:20,875
which also happens to be the main
component of natural gas.

27
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,435
In the short term,

28
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:27,675
methane is more than 80 times
more potent than CO2

29
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:31,035
[at] trapping heat in the atmosphere.

30
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:36,435
Let's compare this year's CO2 emissions
from burning fossil fuels

31
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:39,675
to this year's methane emissions.

32
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:43,675
As you can see,
there's way, way more CO2.

33
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:45,435
But this methane

34
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:49,195
will cause as much warming
over the next 10 years

35
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:52,635
as all of that CO2.

36
00:01:52,636 --> 00:01:57,675
My research team in Texas
used these newer handheld devices

37
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:01,715
to detect and quantify methane emissions

38
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:04,595
from oil and gas facilities.

39
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:06,475
This is something very important.

40
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:09,715
Once you're able to know
where the leaks are coming from,

41
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:12,515
the solutions are extremely simple.

42
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:17,555
And in most cases,
they're not expensive at all.

43
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:21,395
I realized that methane pollution
from the oil and gas industry

44
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:24,515
is so important, that five years ago,

45
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:30,395
I packed my things and moved
my entire family from Texas to Europe

46
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,955
to do something about it.

47
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:35,675
But does that make any sense?

48
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:36,875
I moved from Texas,

49
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:40,555
which is one of the world's major
oil and gas producing regions,

50
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:41,755
to Europe,

51
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:46,555
who is already pushing
to phase out fossil fuels.

52
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:50,595
What was I thinking,
and why was I needed in Europe?

53
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:52,875
Well let me explain.

54
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:55,595
The EU has set a very ambitious goal

55
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:58,275
to become climate neutral by 2050,

56
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:00,995
and this is part
of the European Green Deal.

57
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:04,995
Climate neutral means more than reducing
greenhouse gas emissions

58
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:06,635
within Europe's borders.

59
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:09,675
It also means not importing products

60
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:13,315
that are causing emissions elsewhere.

61
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:14,795
For example,

62
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:19,515
what if oil and gas companies
were releasing huge amounts of methane

63
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:25,035
as they drill for the oil and gas
that they want to send to Europe?

64
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:29,995
The good news is that the EU
recently passed a landmark law

65
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:32,795
to avoid that from happening.

66
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,035
And this is how it works.

67
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:38,835
To gain access to the European
oil and gas market,

68
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:42,875
which today remains one
of the largest in the world,

69
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,755
companies all around the world

70
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:47,795
are going to have to cut
their methane emissions,

71
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:52,515
just as European producers
are also required to do.

72
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:54,635
The details are still being sorted out,

73
00:03:54,636 --> 00:04:00,475
but this access to market is likely
to be based on methane intensity.

74
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:03,635
That is the total amount
of methane emissions

75
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:06,235
as a percentage of production.

76
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:07,435
For example,

77
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:12,115
companies could be held
to a standard of as little as two-tenths

78
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:15,715
of one percent of their production.

79
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,555
As with all policies,

80
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:20,675
success depends on implementation,

81
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:24,675
and the EU methane policy
still needs to be implemented

82
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:27,915
across the 27 member states.

83
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,435
Now here's something really important.

84
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,715
How are we going to know

85
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:34,875
that oil and gas companies
all around the world

86
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:37,555
are actually complying with this?

87
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:41,115
How are we going to be able to check
that emissions are really going down,

88
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:44,435
which of course, at the end of the day,
is what we need to see?

89
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:48,515
It sounds unrealistic
that we could walk around the world

90
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:52,755
with those handheld devices,
like the ones my team was using in Texas.

91
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:53,995
But the good news

92
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:58,675
is that methane monitoring tools
have significantly evolved,

93
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:01,755
and scientists have
developed newer sensors

94
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:04,675
that work from larger distances.

95
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:06,475
First from airplanes,

96
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:10,475
and most recently from space.

97
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:15,515
MethaneSAT and other satellites
are already scanning the globe,

98
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,675
looking at all those different places

99
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:20,875
where oil and gas production
is taking place.

100
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:27,395
They're already delivering
accurate methane data in near-real time,

101
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:34,275
which is at the heart of making
the new EU methane strategy work.

102
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:36,915
It also explains why
the EU helped establish

103
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,355
the International Methane
Emissions Observatory,

104
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,595
where I do some of my work.

105
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:45,635
This observatory is not a telescope.

106
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,155
It's a global data hub

107
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:51,115
hosted by the UN Environment Programme,

108
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:54,955
and it's already bringing together
data from different satellites

109
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:57,075
and monitoring tools.

110
00:05:57,076 --> 00:06:01,195
It will soon allow us to measure, monitor,

111
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:04,275
report and verify methane emissions

112
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:09,875
from different oil and gas producers
in a consistent way.

113
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:11,955
The world is watching

114
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:16,635
as this unprecedented
public access to data

115
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:23,475
promises to hold oil and gas producers
accountable for their emissions.

116
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:28,595
Data will make a difference,
just as it did in Mexico City.

117
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,355
And weâ€™ve got momentum.

118
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:33,595
More than 50 companies,

119
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:37,355
representing 40 percent of global
oil and gas production,

120
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:41,275
have already committed
to reduce their own methane emissions

121
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:46,675
by almost 90 percent
by the end of this decade.

122
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:49,795
And more than 150 countries

123
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:52,875
have already signed
the Global Methane Pledge,

124
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:57,195
committing to serious methane action.

125
00:06:57,196 --> 00:07:04,035
Of course, all of this commitment
and pledges need to become real.

126
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:06,595
And Europe is just the beginning.

127
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:10,315
Already, Japan and South Korea
have formed a coalition

128
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:12,595
and are also looking at methane emissions

129
00:07:12,596 --> 00:07:18,875
as a condition to access their own
oil and gas import market.

130
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:20,075
In a sense,

131
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:24,195
the EU methane policy
can serve as a blueprint

132
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:28,595
as other countries and regions implement

133
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:32,915
data-driven climate action.

134
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,955
Even beyond methane.

135
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,115
For example,

136
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:39,475
we could look at the emission
footprint from other products

137
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:43,875
such as cement, steel or wood.

138
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:47,395
Or we could look at other sources
of methane beyond oil and gas,

139
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:52,395
such as agriculture and landfills.

140
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,555
My day-to-day work as a scientist

141
00:07:54,556 --> 00:08:00,795
revolves around data,
technology and policy.

142
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:04,115
But I'm also a father of two little kids,

143
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:09,875
which makes my hope for the future
deeply, deeply personal.

144
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:14,075
Picking up the pace
at which we phase out fossil fuels

145
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,155
will dramatically shape

146
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:19,115
and change the world
our kids will inherit,

147
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:21,675
and we need to do this fast.

148
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:23,675
But in the meantime,

149
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:28,715
cutting methane emissions
is by far the fastest way

150
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,675
to slow warming today,

151
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:35,035
having an immediate impact for the people,

152
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:39,195
just as Mexico City did
with air pollution,

153
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:41,355
by using data and policy,

154
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:44,035
when I was a little kid.

155
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,315
(Spanish) Y es por eso 
que tengo esperanza.

156
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:48,755
(English) This is why Iâ€™m hopeful,

157
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:53,795
because we're using data not only
to understand the methane problem,

158
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:56,955
but to actually fix it.

159
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,115
Thank you.

160
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:03,116
(Applause)
